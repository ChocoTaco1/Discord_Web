							<br>Tribes 2 isn't easy to master, and it won't play well on every gaming PC, but when you're up and running it's a tremendous amount of fun.

							<p>When Starsiege: Tribes came out at the very end of 1998, it was the first of its kind: a retail first-person shooter designed specifically for multiplayer competition. The intervening years have seen other popular action games focused primarily on multiplayer competition, but none have had the same emphasis on teamplay in large, wide-open areas, with plenty of players participating in each match. Not until Tribes 2. Experienced Tribes players will find that the sequel makes relatively few changes to the successful core mechanics of the original but that it features substantially improved graphics, even larger network games, and more items, vehicles, and equipment to use in battle. For those new to the series, Tribes 2 also offers extensive offline training options. Unfortunately, a number of technical problems in the initial retail release have dampened some players' enthusiasm for what is otherwise an outstanding multiplayer action game.</p>
							
							<p>Tribes 2 inherits its sci-fi setting from Dynamix's series of mech games, including Earthsiege and Starsiege. Much of what distinguishes Tribes 2's style from that of other first-person shooters stems from this background, including the distinctively large outdoor settings in the game, and also the focus on high-tech equipment such as jump jets and mobile armor suits. Most of the contextual story built up in the earlier games has since fallen away, along with the "Starsiege" surname, since most players came to refer to the original simply as "Tribes" anyway. But the context of Tribes 2 still lends some coherence to the in-game taunts and the mix of harsh environments that will become your playground. You have the choice of three classes of mobile armor suits to wear in battle--the light scout, medium assault, and heavy juggernaut--and they differ in mobility and arsenal. All the classes have a lot of equipment choices and can carry three to five weapons, plus grenades, mines, and a special equipment pack all at once. The inventory system has been significantly streamlined in the new game, so you can set up equipment presets that go into effect when you use a base inventory station anytime during a match.</p>
							
							<p>Tribes 2's different style extends to its pacing, which is somewhat slower and more deliberate than what you'd find in some other popular shooters such as Unreal Tournament and Counter-Strike. The first thing you'll notice in comparison is the effect that the jetpack has on combat. The jetpack gives you limited upward or directional thrust, and though it takes a while to learn how to combine this with ordinary ground movement, the combination is potent, so players in light and medium suits move very quickly over rough terrain. Players jetting through the air are quite difficult to hit with the game's slow projectile weapons, so combat between aerial players often focuses on trying to lead an opponent's landing to deliver explosive splash damage. The game's direct attack weapons make it possible to fell a flying opponent, and the new heat-seeking missile launcher adds an additional threat that's hard to shake once it locks on. The net effect of the game's mobile armors suits and jetpacks is to make combat less decisive and less deadly in wide-open outdoor terrain, while the explosive heavy weapons and turret defenses tend to keep indoor brawls vicious and short. But there's room for you to play various niche roles, such as when you're equipped with the cloaking pack and the game's new melee weapon, the shocklance--a combination that can be used to sneak up on enemies inside their own base for a fatal backstab.</p>
							
							<p>The game offers a lot more than just deathmatch and capture-the-flag game modes. The free-for-all variations derived from popular Starsiege: Tribes mods are good for games with fewer players and make the most of Tribes 2's map style. Rabbit is a single-flag game where the player who carries the flag is "it." There's often a terrific scrimmage as other players try to grab the flag and make a run back to their bases. Hunters is reminiscent of the headhunter mods for other multiplayer games. As players die, they drop flags that can be collected for points at a central location. The real scramble happens when someone who's gathered a lot of flags is fragged, an event that's greeted with a jubilant "Yard sale!" voice-over as opponents gather to fight over the remains.</p>
							
							<p>However, it's with the large team games that Tribes 2 is really impressive. The scale of these games is unmatched; there will often be 40 to 60 (or even more) players on a single server. The game's network code is quite good and supports these numbers well on servers with sufficient dedicated bandwidth, but some warping does occur in games containing many more than 60 players. The larger maps easily accommodate this many players and generally feature vehicle pads so that a portion of each team spends its time in the game's six vehicles.</p>
							
							<p>There are many roles you can fill during a game of Tribes 2: these include sniping, setting up defenses, and going on runs in the three-man bomber to destroy enemy structures and turrets. It's easy enough to switch roles to do whatever needs to be done to help the team, so casual matches without explicit team planning can still be quite enjoyable. The game's command map makes the chaos of the battlefield a little easier to understand. It shows the status of teammates, base facilities, and the team sensor network that ties into each player's HUD. While the command interface is cumbersome, it does give you a fairly effective system for suggesting what team tasks need to be accomplished.</p>
							
							<p>While having vehicles in smaller games, those with fewer than 20 people, can dilute the action, overall they add an extra dimension to the combat in Tribes 2. There are three ground vehicles and three air vehicles, divided among scout, assault, and support craft. Half of these (the larger ones) let two or more players jump on board, which can require some coordination around a map's vehicle pad. However, the tank and bomber craft require such particular cooperation between the pilot and gunner that it can be very frustrating to pair up with someone who's less experienced. Additionally, the larger vehicles are sluggish and can be fairly difficult to control, and you may even find that the nose of the larger ground vehicles will occasionally pitch up or down unrealistically on rough but relatively level terrain, seemingly due to problems with the game's physics. It's also frustrating that a mere brush with a tree at low speeds can inflict inordinate damage to the most imposing hovertank.</p>
							
							<p>To make it easier to talk to other players in between games and organize teams, Tribes 2 has a number of online community features built right into the game. The active Starsiege: Tribes community is a strong point in favor of Tribes 2, and right from the start there have been hundreds of game servers to choose from. In fact, high loads on the central authentication and community servers since the release of Tribes 2 have made it impossible for Dynamix to run all the community services, but the game finder, news, and chat functions are up and working. The other features, like pages for team and player information as well as integrated e-mail and Web browsing, were working in the beta tests but have been temporarily disabled until the servers can be upgraded.</p>
							
							<p>Tribes 2 is primarily an online game, but it does include more solo options than its predecessor. It includes five tutorials to ease the learning curve and introduce new players to the game's unique movement, numerous items, and command options. Many of the maps can also be played against computer-controlled bot opponents, which can help you get used to the game before jumping online. The bots aren't really capable enough to make offline games very interesting, and though they do manage to carry out team functions, like setting up basic defenses and executing flag runs, they aren't particularly good at it. They also seem to stand in place more often than you'd expect.</p>
							
							<p>The most obvious difference between Tribes and Tribes 2 is the new graphics engine in the sequel, which was completely reworked to take advantage of hardware acceleration and more powerful PCs. If you do have a high-end system, the game looks good. On the maps that aren't fogged in by design, the visible horizon is distant and sharp. The explosions are suitably impressive, and there are some nice effects like footsteps on snow maps and variable precipitation. A fractal system also produces smoothly varying terrain textures that have a surprising amount of detail up close. However, as a result of these effects and the game's large environments, many mainstream systems play the game sluggishly unless many of the effects are turned off and textures are turned down. At these lower levels of detail, the game doesn't look particularly good at all, even compared to the original Tribes. To play the game well, we'd recommend a system with at least a 600MHz Pentium III and a GeForce or Radeon graphics card. As ambitious shooters tend to, the Tribes 2 engine has room to grow as faster systems become more common. For example, one of the systems we tried the game on, a Pentium 4 1.5GHz with GeForce2 Ultra, had no trouble maintaining a very smooth frame rate at 1024x768 with maximum detail turned on.</p>
							
							<p>A lot of effort obviously went into rounding out the game, but it still has some rough edges. The game's sound is quite polished, including many prerecorded voice taunts that you can use in-game by selecting them from a series of quick chat menus. Tribes 2 includes a custom soundtrack--an unsurprising mix of electronica and guitar that you'll probably turn down before long. But the game's biggest shortcoming is that it released with several significant technical problems, which Dynamix is progressively addressing in frequent patches. The game runs without problems on many systems, but some players have had difficulty getting it to work at all.</p>
							
							<p>Tribes 2 is an ambitious follow-up to the game that single-handedly led the charge of multiplayer-only action games into retail. The deep teamplay that you can find in large matches is incredibly addicting and offers some interesting opportunities to cobble together team strategies. The game takes advantage of skills developed in twitch shooters like Quake, but its slower pacing requires a more deliberate and diverse range of tactics. In the end, this will help give Tribes 2 tremendous longevity, especially considering that the original Tribes still rivals both Unreal Tournament and Quake III Arena as one of the most played multiplayer action games. Tribes 2 isn't easy to master, and it won't play well on every gaming PC, but when you're up and running it's a tremendous amount of fun.</p>

							<p>I move without fear among the tribal kin of the Slavers, wearing the weak shape I have endured since emerging from the changing vats. My copy of the tribal human we captured is very good; so far no one has questioned the gaps in my knowledge as a result of "head injury," and I observe and gather information without interference. Comrades think me slow-witted, so their tongues wag freely in my presence. My pheromone implants let me draw information from a variety of unwitting sources; a lover in the starport here provided me datalinks to the troop manifests. I disposed of her afterwards. The frozen oceans here contain an admirable predator called a 'razor hag.' We shall have to capture some gene samples after we eradicate the humans and claim the planet.</p>
							
							<p>Preliminary assessments indicate- wait…</p>
							
							<p>I must be brief. The damned Skaduvarg - that is what the Starwolf Security calls itself - must have traced the quantum ripple of my transmitter. I was able to relocate without losing my connection, but the Skaduvarg are likely only temporarily delayed. I will have to abandon the transmitter… if I escape alive.</p>
							
							<p>The Great Traitor is correct. Great numbers of Starwolf muster here in cramped orbital stations or temporary surface camps. Many are inexperienced warriors, snot-nosed vatscum called 'newbloods' who think to learn war and survive the lesson. I befriended one the other day, and she's provided me with good cover, the little fool.</p>
							
							<p>As you already know, the Starwolf prepare to assault the neighboring Charybdis system. A woman called Fury leads the Blood Eagle there. Thanks to the Great Traitor, she lacks the strength to offer battle, so we can devour her at our leisure after we take Ymir. I wish I could see Fury in chains. From what I hear, she would make good sport.</p>
							
							<p>The other major tribes are not a threat. Simpering Children of Phoenix whine about peace at their Firetruce, but nobody cares. Other vatsatz brethren are in place to keep them and the Diamond Sword at each other's throats. Diamond Sword deployments indicate the Sworders smell something of the truth regarding the Empire, but they have said nothing to the Starwolf.</p>
							
							<p>Curse it, the hunters are getting close. They must know I'm here. Not much time left….</p>
							
							<p>The jumpgate is secure against Blood Eagle incursion, but not against us. Defensive platforms maintain a tight ring around the system entry points, but once our reavers pass this ring, Ymir and the Starwolf are-
							Urh, that hurts. A human stumbled onto my hiding place. Bad luck for him, but he singed me before I twisted his head off. No sign of the other hunters yet. Where was I?</p>
							
							<p>The Starwolf here are nothing but fresh meat. At least half the tribal dropships undergo repairs and status checks with only skeleton crews aboard. The attached Starwolf IFF code strings should delay any defensive response until it is too late.</p>
							
							<p>They're coming. Damn the Skadus! Control, this is my last transmission. I must destroy this sender. If I escape, I will flee Ymir and continue gathering intelligence elsewhere. If I do not survive, I shall return to serve the Bloodsoul in another form. Let my crèche kin know I died a hero of the Hordes.</p>

							<font color="05d200"><font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font></font> … probably listening, damn them. Can you ascertain?<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font> Maybe. (pause) No. I can't find anything. If Cardinal Spear is listening, they've concealed their snoopers well. But remember, my hardware's detection peripherals aren't state-of-the-art.<br>
							<font color="05d200"><font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font></font> Of course. Always excuses, woman. I am yet again reminded of how you failed me.<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font> I didn't fail you, by the Wolf! Face the truth.<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> I see truth constantly, my dear Freya. And the truth of your betrayal burns like fire. Ah, God, after all these years it still pains me to remember how you turned your back on me! Do you feel triumph at the wound you opened on that day?<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font> How could I turn my back on you? I don't even have a body; what you see is a projected hologram simulation. And you know I can't feel triumph.<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> (laugh) I very much doubt that, witch.<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font> You set my design specs. You know my capabilities better than anyone else.<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> Who made whom, I wonder. Yes, I wonder. Now, this matter with DeBures. Do you truly believe he has joined Fury?<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font> From what my datafiles tell me of Pennant-Commander Ram DeBures, he would sooner die than betray his vows to you. I have to conclude he's either a hostage or a dead man.<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> No, no, he's betrayed me, as have so many others. God curse that faithless bastard! Where's his family? Why are the heads of his children not on my table?<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font> You didn't give the order.<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> Well, I give the order now.<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> It will be difficult. The DeBures bloodline moved the Pennant-Commander's family offworld out of respect for your disappointment at his failure. If you retaliate against his family without good cause, you will alienate the entire bloodline.<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> My God, traitors surround me! What of the other bloodlines-aside from those bastard-born Starkweathers? How do they see the defection of Sier DeBures?<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font> The Halakar are as hard to read as ever, but my guess is they secretly back Fury. She has to have some source for all the weapons and supplies she's using to fortify Charybdis. The Nagashima, Sabot-Styx, and DeBures support you fully, as do the Konovalev, of course. I don't know about the Eun Alba. They've been pretty vocal lately about the danger posed by the Starwolf.<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> Damn them all. Do we have proof that the Halakar bow to Fury?<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font> Of course not.<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> Have I had any of them killed yet?<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font> No.<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> Then let us have one of their junior scions taken and made into an example. Hands and feet only. Sent to Lord Tarun in a nice jeweled box. Yes, that should convey the proper warning.<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font> Alexandre, my programming on human political psychology recommends against this.<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> You have never understood our ways, milady. (pause) Yet I once thought the Starwolf capable of loyalty. Why did you leave me? Why abandon your son? Poor Ulysses was despondent, you know.<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font> (sigh) Freya Cloudchaser, not me - I am a computer-generated hologram, remember? -- terminated the marriage after Geoffrey died. You treated his suicide as an act of cowardice.<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> He was weak! He could never have been my son, damn him! A Konovalev never breaks! Who did you sleep with to produce that milksop, eh? And there was Ulysses still. Ulysses. Ah yes, by God, he was a true son of mine.<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font> (inaudible)<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> What was that you said?<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font> A defective speech subroutine. Forget it.<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> Explain to me what you said. I command you.<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font> I said, "That probability is low" in response to your previous comment about Ulysses being your true son.<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> Christ and Hunter! You dare…!<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font> (screams)<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font> That wasn't necessary.<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> I must punish such insolence harshly. Even from you, my wife.<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font> I am not your wi-(screams)<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> You will always be my wife, Freya. No matter how far you run. No matter how often you deny me, I will always be here to chastise you.<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font> I am an advanced holofeed AI simulacrum, Alexan-(screams)<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> You will address me as "Great and Noble Lord." On your knees.<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font> As you wish, Great and Noble Lord. But I am not your wife. Your son Ulysses is gone. Please try to accept your gri-(screams)<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> Tell me, do you truly feel pain when I press this button, Freya?<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font> Not as you'd understand it, Great and Noble Lord. I feel what you might call "extreme dissonance."<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> I can destroy you with but a simple word. Does that not cause you to fear me?<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font> We've had this conversation many times before, Great and Noble Lord. I'm aware you can verbally trigger a termination subroutine in my programming.<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> And you do fear me, do you not?<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font> I can simulate any emotional state you require.</p>
							<p style="text-align: center;">(4.2 second pause)</p>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> Tell me again about Ursula DiVaragas. Is she truly formidable enough to destroy Fury?<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font> She has the numbers, certainly. Plenty of experience. More than enough hatred.<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> Ah, yes, I understand hatred quite well. I almost feel a kinship with this mongrel. Continue.<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font> I don't have a clear projection as to who would win if they were more evenly matched. However, a Starwolf force substantial enough to roll through Fury at Charybdis would be a real threat in Blood Eagle territory. The Bloodlines are nervous that-<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> The Starwolf are not a threat. I have already seen to their neutralization. (inaudible) …destroy Fury and then perish. (laugh) Good dogs, all.<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font> I don't see how you plan to accomplish that, Great and Noble Lord. The Starwolf are a major problem for you. The Blood Eagle are divided, the Diamond Sword remain neutral, and the Children of Phoenix haven't shown any signs of intervening.<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> Renn Gistos is useless, his Firetruce a sandtrap for cowards. Foolish of him to yield to the Triad's machinations. No other Phoenix Prime would have tolerated even the possibility of such a concession. But rest assured, wife, the Starwolf will discover there are worse things in the heavens than they know of. I know many secrets. DiVaragas will fall after she crushes Fury.</p>
							<p style="text-align: center;">(1.6 second pause)</p>
							But why are you on your knees? Arise and walk with me!<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font> Whatever you say, Great and Noble Lord.<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> So formal, my dear! Call me Alexi, as you did when we were first married.<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font> Whatever you say, Alexi.<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> They underestimate me. They believe me weak, poisoned from betrayal and loss. I will show them otherwise. I will, you know. Now, tell me.<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font> Tell you what?<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> The name of your lover, of course. I'm not stupid.<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font> Alexi, I am not Freya Cloudchaser. I'm a Class Five Galatea Artificial Intelligence Anima running parasapient algorithms on a Theta-level biochip array. My personality is modeled from a detailed psychological profile of your former wife. I don't have the information you want. I would give it to you if I could, but the data is too sparse to be more than rank speculation. I can't project a conclusion with any significant degree of accuracy. Please listen to me.</p>

							<div ul style="text-align:left;">
							<p>Honored Shisou:<br>
							Greetings in the name of the Reflective. I trust you are enjoying your meditations and that your wa remains undisturbed.</p></div>
							<div ul style="text-align:left; list-style-type:square;">
							<li><p>I have little to report on the Phoenix front today. Haitou Asaken has still not circumvented the Prime's countersurveillance, but the elevated degree of secrecy surrounding the Prime suggests something is wrong. We are attempting to attain more concrete data. The only remarkable note I have for you thus far is that the Prime has expressed an unusual interest in the Tsayadin Speaker Shana Dawn Terayl. The only link we have discovered thus far is that Terayl once belonged to the Phoenix tribe before turning independent. This is not new information, but we continue to probe. As you recall, the <li>Pure Facet was most insistent on appointing Terayl to the post.</li><br>
							<li>We identified two Harbinger agents in the Phoenix technical support and communications detachment. Per your previous instructions, they have been placed under discreet surveillance. So far they do nothing more than observe and report back to Malderi at Ashkelon III.</li><br>
							<li>The fraytown and bazaar continue to roil in sporadic outbreaks of lawlessness. Nothing remarkable to report here. A brawl in the Shaganti zone south of the river involved a young off-duty Niwa'aban surodoi and a known interstellar raconteur. Two bystanders were killed, and the raconteur escaped.</li></p>
							
							<div class="clear" style="text-align: center;padding: 7px 0px 5px 0px;">
							<font color="red"><p>&lt;INCIDENT REPORT SUBFILE ACCESS&gt;</font></p>
							
							<p>Our surodoi was unharmed. She returns to duty tomorrow. I believe we will profit from her presence on the hunter detail.
							<li>The tension between the Blood Eagle and the Starwolf has stabilized. We placed armored surodoi as an interdiction between the main encampments, and that has proven a sufficient restraint. Blood Eagle Knights from the Order of the Talon proved to be helpful in keeping the peace. This Order currently maintain nominal fealty to the Great Eagle, but my sources say they are taking a neutral position in the civil war that threatens the Blood Eagle.
							Reflective Facet leaders here received an unusual haiku in this week's sending from Falcon's Crossroad:</li></p>
							
							<em><p>In the midst of flames<br>
							Hides a flower of diamond<br>
							Ah, the early frost!</p></em></div>
							
							<p>I regret I do not have an answer for this yet, Honored Shisou. We are meditating on it. Laracon believes it is a warning, and that is what my intuition tells me as well. Cryptic instructions regarding Trigon strategies accompanied the haiku, and I have ordered those instructions carried out. Curiously, we have received queries from the Pure Facet regarding any and all communications from the Triad. Perhaps your Juma connections will be able to enlighten us as to this sudden interest from the priesthood.</p>
							
							<div ul style="text-align:left; list-style-type:square;">
							<p><li>You asked me to report any particularly mysterious events that occurred here. I have only one. A minor incident, but remarkable. It seems that on the fringes of the Bazaar, someone murdered three Grievers and disappeared. Literally disappeared, Honored One. The reports we took describe how this man walked out past a half-dozen armed Grievers and simply vanished after entering the crowd. There was no indication of a cloaking field, and the Grievers pursued with motion detectors. Several witnesses confirmed the reports. It is as if they saw a ghost.</li>
							<li>Further, the dead Grievers had no marks on them aside from slight bruising where they each received their deathblow. Autopsies concluded that in each case, death resulted from a single blow to the neck or the temple, and very likely occurred instantly. Expressions on the faces of the victims suggest they had no time to react. Remarkable if only one perpetrator was responsible. It suggests a killer of extreme competence, possibly artificially enhanced. Motive is still unproven, but we believe the Grievers had something this "ghost" wanted to obtain. The Grievers became truculent in response to questions about their merchandise, and a niwa'aban search discovered a surprising amount of contraband, including Imperial black market goods.</li><p></div>
							
							<p>That is all, Honored Shisou. We look forward to your return next month.</p>
							<p>May the Enlightened Master bring you clarity.<br></p>

							<p><font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> Uhhh… Where am I?<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font>  Bring the lights back up slowly, Esgil.<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> Who are you guys?<br>
							<font color="079866">&lt;Voice 3&gt;:</font>  I'm popping the restraints.<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font>  Wait a minute-<br>
							<font color="079866">&lt;Voice 3&gt;:</font>  He checks out. No indication of biotech implants or abnormal physiology. He's no vatsatz.<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> Vat what?<br>
							<font color="079866">&lt;Voice 3&gt;:</font>  Vatsatz. Either a BioDerm or an Imperial bioengineered spy. We're not sure which.<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font>  My money's on the Hordes.<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> Who are you guys?<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font>  Friends. Trust us.<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> Right. You just said you didn't want to let me out of that chair. Why should I trust you?<br>
							<font color="079866">&lt;Voice 3&gt;:</font>  Because we're Starwolf too.<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> I never heard of you. Where are you from? What system? What pack?<br>
							<font color="079866">&lt;Voice 3&gt;:</font>  We can't tell you.<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font>  You wouldn't believe us anyway.<br>
							<font color="079866">&lt;Voice 3&gt;:</font>  We are Starwolf, though. Distant kin.<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font> (mutters): You can say that again.<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> I don't buy it. If you're Starwolf, why this symbol? It's not the face of the Great Wolf.<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font>  Listen, the Great Wolf has many faces, OK? This is one of them. Now let's get to your story.<br>
							<font color="079866">&lt;Voice 3&gt;:</font>  We want you to tell us about Ymir.<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> Why do you want to know about Ymir?<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font>  We're trying to find out as much as we can. Do you mind?<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> I still don't know who in Dark you are. Without something more, you aren't getting scat.<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font>  By the Starred Hunter! I can't believe you're dragging things on like this! We told you we're Starwolf! We showed you our tats when we picked you up! We knew the hand codes!<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> Sorry, but that's where you screwed up.<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font>  What?<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> Yeah, those codes are only used for ceremonial hunting purposes these days. (laugh) Dark, it's like using Latin or English instead of Neolac. You don't have a clue about basic Starwolf combat code.<br>
							<font color="079866">&lt;Voice 3&gt;:</font>  We pulled you out of that ship before it was too late.<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> Thanks, but maybe you didn't do me that much of a favor.<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font>  What, you'd rather be dead of radiation poisoning? Excuse us for misunderstanding kin ties!<br>
							<font color="079866">&lt;Voice 3&gt;:</font>  Shut up, Wrett. I'm going to tell him.<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font>  You can't, Esgil! That's crazy! Tell him and you compromise three hundred years of effort and endanger us all.<br>
							<font color="079866">&lt;Voice 3&gt;:</font>  He's kin. That's why we're here, remember? Besides, I'm the ranking officer here.<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> What in Dark are you talking about?<br>
							<font color="079866">&lt;Voice 3&gt;:</font>  It's easier for me to show you. Come on.<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font>  This is a mistake, Esgil.<br>
							<font color="079866">&lt;Voice 3&gt;:</font>  It's my call, Wrett. We need to talk to a survivor. An eyewitness.<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font>  …<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font>  Fine. Don't say I didn't warn you.<br>
							<font color="079866">&lt;Voice 3&gt;:</font>  Come on. Liamm, isn't it? This way.<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> I've never seen this ship design before.<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font>  What a klickin' surprise.<br>
							<font color="079866">&lt;Voice 3&gt;:</font>  (sigh) Hunter's bones, Wrett. Could you be any more of an ass? This is our bridge.<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> Interesting design. Looks about as Starwolf as a sandraker's temple.<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font>  Told you he wouldn't believe.<br>
							<font color="079866">&lt;Voice 3&gt;:</font>  We haven't told him yet, damn it.<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> Told me what?<br>
							<font color="079866">&lt;Voice 3&gt;:</font>  We told you we were distant kinfolk, yes?<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> And you've gotten a lot wrong for me to believe you, remember?<br>
							<font color="079866">&lt;Voice 3&gt;:</font>  This is our home system. One of them, anyway.<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> Huh. Never heard of it. B-class binary like that? Doesn't seem like there's much in the way of a life zone, even if you found terrestrial planets there.<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font>  There is no life zone there.<br>
							<font color="079866">&lt;Voice 3&gt;:</font>  Here's the population numbers.<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> (laugh) You have to be kidding!<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font>  What?<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> There isn't a planet in the wilderzone with that kind of population. Where the Dark is this place?<br>
							<font color="079866">&lt;Voice 3&gt;:</font>  Here.<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> …<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font>  Damn. If that doesn't look like one of Alice's monkey frogs, I'll eat my armor.<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> (whispers) That's impossible.<br>
							<font color="079866">&lt;Voice 3&gt;:</font>  Very possible. With the right mapping.<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> You-you're telling the truth about this?<br>
							<font color="079866">&lt;Voice 3&gt;:</font>  You bet.<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font>  You want me to get you a drink… cousin?<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> Yeah. A stiff one.<br>
							<font color="079866">&lt;Voice 3&gt;:</font>  You OK?<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> You mind if I sit down?<br>
							<font color="079866">&lt;Voice 3&gt;:</font>  Be my guest. Over here, if you don't mind.<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font>  Here's your drink. Now will you tell us about Ymir?<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> Don't you know what happened?<br>
							<font color="079866">&lt;Voice 3&gt;:</font>  Just the general details.<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> Ah, damn. It wasn't supposed to happen… the way it did.<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font>  Come on, man, pull it together! I thought you nearsiders had stones.<br>
							<font color="079866">&lt;Voice 3&gt;:</font>  Ease off, Wrett. He's been through a lot, for Hunter's sake!<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font>  Shh…! <br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> …been mustering for two months. Strikepacks with warriors from over forty systems streamed to Ymir. I'd never seen so many Wolves at once. No one had. Dark, there was even a girl who came from Narhaven out on the Fringe. Can you believe that?<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font>  Narhaven? Where the hell is that? <br>
							<font color="079866">&lt;Voice 3&gt;:</font>  Near Scipio. Now quiet.<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> We had an army that was the greatest single fighting muster the wilderzone had ever seen.<br>
							And we had Ursula DiVaragas heading it. By the Great Wolf, how could we lose? There was no way the Blood Eagle could win. No way!<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font>  They smacked you, didn't they?<br>
							<font color="079866">&lt;Voice 3&gt;:</font>  Wrett, will you shut the Dark up?<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font>  They were there, weren't they? I heard the Blood Eagle were there.<br>
							<font color="079866">&lt;Voice 3&gt;:</font>  Transmitted reports were garbled. We didn't confirm-<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> No.<br>
							<font color="079866">&lt;Voice 3&gt;:</font>  Excuse me?<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> The B-E didn't 'smack' us. We had some Blood Eagle prisoners on Ymir, but that was it.
							You want to hear this or not?<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font>  Yeah. Sorry.<br>
							<font color="079866">&lt;Voice 3&gt;:</font>  Let's pause this recording for now. Take a break and go below. I think I want a drink in
							hand myself for this story.<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> Whatever. Hey, are you really from...</div></p>

							<p>&lt;&lt;Holy Hunter. That's not the same man he used to be. Look at the indications of weight loss.&gt;&gt;<br>
							((He's an old man.))<br>
							&lt;&lt;Yes, but four months ago he had at least twenty more kilos on him. Check the records.&gt;&gt;</div>
							<p><font color="079866">RENN GISTOS:</font> Hardly that, Jamez. There is a Speaker here, you know. I'm just an old man trying to help bring people together.</p>

							<font color="079866">RG:</font> That's true. We should probably host it more frequently, but really it's a culmination of a lot of other diplomatic work over the years. Given the vastness of the wilderzone, having regular Firetruces would become quite tiring very quickly, I suspect.<br>

							<div ul style="text-align:left;"><font color="079866"><p>RG:</font> I have much hope, Jamez. The Tribes of Man are weary of war.<br>

							<div ul style="text-align:left;"><p><font color="05d200">ZV:</font> Tell that to the Blood Eagle and the Starwolf, Milord. We understand Fury is mounting a campaign that will start another B-E civil war.<br>

							&lt;&lt;Are you kidding me?&gt;&gt;<br>

							&lt;&lt;Computer, freeze frame. OK, take a look. See the tightening of his jaw here?&gt;&gt;<br>
							((Yes. Interesting.))<br>
							&lt;&lt;That's a man in pain. A lot of it.&gt;&gt;<br>
							((OK, so we know he's suffering, and we have a better idea of what's causing the weight loss.))<br>
							&lt;&lt;How in hells did they keep this under wraps?&gt;&gt;<br>
							((The wilderzone's a big place. Spies can't be everywhere.))<br>
							&lt;&lt;Yeah, yeah. Computer, resume play.&gt;&gt;<br>
							<font color="079866">RG:</font> Nothing… nothing. The… thought struck me that… the war might well result in the indiscriminate use of ecocidals.<br>
							&lt;&lt;Nice recovery, Renn, but I don't think she buys it.&gt;&gt;</div></p>

							<font color="079866">RG:</font> I am recovering from a touch of the X-pox, nothing more. (laughs) But thank you for your concern. It's quite touching.<br>
							<font color="05d200">ZV:</font> Can you tell us why you've allowed the Diamond Sword to host this Firetruce? I understand it was quite a controversial decision in your own ranks.<br>
							&lt;&lt;That's THE hardball question.&gt;&gt;<br>
							((Quiet.))<br>
							<font color="079866">RG:</font> It was an easy decision. The Children of Phoenix are the First Tribe, and we've borne the responsibility of the Firetruce for centuries. It was time to see whether one of the other tribes was willing to shoulder the responsibilities of leading the search for tribal unity.<br>
							<font color="05d200">ZV:</font> So you're ceding leadership to the Diamond Sword?</div></p>
							<div ul style="text-align:center;"><p><font color="e8b857">ZOOM TO CLOSE UP OF PHOENIX PRIME.</font></div></p>
							<div ul style="text-align:left;"><p><font color="079866">RG:</font> We're not relinquishing our historic primacy, no. We are broadening the scope of who may participate in steering the institution, however. I can tell you Unity will not happen unless all the Great Tribes take a fair share of responsibility. That means we Phoenix have to adopt a more inclusive strategy.</p></div>

							<font color="079866">RG:</font> (laughs) You have found us out, Jamez. The independents must also play a role.<br>
							<font color="05d200">ZV:</font> Let's turn to her for a moment. She's very young, isn't she?<br>
							<font color="079866">RG:</font> Yes, but I - we - have the utmost confidence that she will rise to the occasion. She's a remarkable individual.<br>
							<font color="05d200">ZV:</font> Very popular among the independents. Did you choose her yourself, Milord?<br>
							<font color="079866">RG:</font> Hardly. We worked with the Diamond Sword on Firetruce arrangements, and her name floated to the top.<br>
							<font color="05d200">ZV:</font> Milord, are you an aficionado of Trigon?<br>
							<font color="079866">RG:</font> Eh?<br>
							<font color="05d200">ZV:</font> This board between us. There's a game in progress, obviously. Who's your opponent?</div></p>

							<div ul style="text-align:left;"><font color="079866"><p>RG:</font> Ah, yes. Trigon is such an elegant game. So subtle. I'm not very good, you know, but I hope to improve. Here I'm merely playing against myself.<br>
							((I believe he's lying here. The indicators show a tension spike. Look here. And here.))<br>
							&lt;&lt;Interesting. You think there's something else going on.&gt;&gt;<br>
							((Yes. Take a still of that board position and have it analyzed. Get a para-sape on it.))<br>

							&lt;&lt;Now she's just fishing. Malderi's a psychopath and everyone knows it.&gt;&gt;<br>
							((He's very popular in the Children of Phoenix. Remember, he's calling for a return to the good old days of elitist glory. He could be a real threat to the Empire if he wins power.))<br>

							<div ul style="text-align:left;"><p>(female soprano)<br>
							Alexandre Konovalev and Freya Cloudchaser.<br>
							It seemed a modern Romeo and Juliet story: the brilliant young ruler of the Blood Eagle and the beautiful daughter of a Starwolf Chieftain united in matrimony as a symbol of peace between two warring tribes.<br></div>
							<div ul style="text-align:center;"><em><p>Music -- Albinoni's Cinque in G Minor, first movement</em></p>
							<div ul style="text-align:left;"><font color="red">VIDCLIP</font> - A handsome young couple smiles at the camera. He is dark-haired and aquiline, clad in a blood-red dress uniform; she is blonde, blue-eyed, and wears a white robe adorned with a stylized wolf knotwork pattern. He holds a heavy saber at a jaunty angle. She holds a spear decorated with a trail of Kyorn feathers.</p>
							<p>Man (stealing a tender glance at the woman): Let this marriage represent an end to the traditional hostility between our tribes. We can make a new beginning, all of us. Together we need not choose war.<br>
							Woman (gravely): If Wolf and Eagle can make peace, can the rest of the wilderzone be far behind?</div></p>
							<div ul style="text-align:center;"><font color="e8b857"><p>NARRATOR</p></font></div>
							<div ul style="text-align:left;"><p>Reality would not to live up to the hopes kindled by the marriage of early part of 3904, despite the birth of twins in 3904 and a second son in 3905. Indeed, the falling-out of these star-crossed lovers would eventually claim the lives of their children and leave their tribes deeply entangled in a web of bitter hatred and bloodshed.</p>
							<p><font color="red">VIDCLIP</font> - Image of Alexandre and Freya freezes, and flames consume it, leaving the faces until the end.</p>
							<div ul style="text-align:center;"><font color="e8b857"><p>NARRATOR</p></font></div>
							<div ul style="text-align:left;"><p>The disastrous culmination of their separation would take place in 3932 with the use of ecocidal weapons on the Starwolf world of Hepta Ourubis Two. H-O Two, as it is commonly called, is located near the edge of Blood Eagle Territory. A jumpgate thread leads to the B-E world of Shaakhar Crucis, an important hub with links to the key Blood Eagle worlds of Bira Marduk and Bloodjewel.</p>

							<div ul style="text-align:center;"><font color="e8b857"><p>NARRATOR</p></font></div>
							<p>The years after 3904 saw a steadily growing estrangement between Alexandre and Freya, a division fueled by Alexandre's deteriorating temper. But the early years were good, and the couple seemed to personify the hopes of the wilderzone for peace between the Blood Eagle and the Starwolf.</p>
							<font color="red"><p>VIDCLIP</font> - A dark-haired toddler boy laughs and plays with Alexandre. Freya sits in foreground holding a golden-headed infant. A second dark-haired toddler watches from next to Freya's chair, a shadow on her face.</p>
							<div ul style="text-align:center;"><font color="e8b857"><p>NARRATOR</p></font></div>
							<p>As the years wore on, Alexandre utterly indulged his second son Ulysses, permitting the boy any liberty he wished and showing little regard for anyone else, especially his first-born children Geoffrey and Alyxandra. Ulysses would inherit signs of his father's strategic genius, but his talent was obscured by his contempt for the advice of anyone other than than his father, even his respected weapons instructor and bodyguard, Sikkyn-Captain Starkar Mace. Mace had been assigned to guard Freya shortly after the announcement of the betrothal, and she insisted he become the special protector of her son. He and Ulysses developed a close relationship.</p>
							<p><font color="red">VIDCLIP</font> - On a balcony overlooking a frozen lake, a young Ulysses throws his furred hood back and looks up at his father, revealing a head of bright golden hair.
							Cut to a procession in Court at Outermost. Alexandre walks with Ulysses at his side while two slender dark-haird children walk behind. Alexandre puts his arm around Ulysses's shoulder and squeezes before letting go and ascending to take his place on the throne. At this point, Ulysses is still</p>
							<p>Cut to Ulysses as a young teenager, tall and well-muscled. He examines a katar in the company of a powerfully-built, square-jawed warrior. They stand on what appears to be a training ground in a courtyard. Freya watches from a balcony in the background as the older man demonstrates a fighting stance.</p>
							<div ul style="text-align:center;"><font color="e8b857"><p>NARRATOR</p></font></div>
							<p>Sometime in 3910, Alexandre began to change. His attitude toward the Starwolf became first distant, then increasingly quarrelsome as he began to display signs of paranoia and an uncontrollable temper. Ulysses remained the center of his world.</p>
							<p><font color="red">VIDCLIP</font> - Alexandre presides over a Court meeting on Outermost. He looks tense. Deep lines have etched themselves in his face. Ulysses stands behind him, taller and in his late teens. He is broad-shouldered and deep chested, every inch the warrior born. His lip curls as he hears something said by a courtier.</p>
							<div ul style="text-align:center;"><font color="e8b857"><p>NARRATOR</p></font></div>
							<p>Alexandre had little time for his other children, and even sent his daughter to be fostered by another Bloodline in 3915, over Freya's objections.</p>
							<p><font color="red">VIDCLIP</font> - Freya hugs a dark-haired young girl goodbye as a shuttle prepares to depart. There are no tears, but their embrace lingers, and the girl visibly catches her breath before climbing up the ramp to enter the shuttle.</p>
							<div ul style="text-align:center;"><font color="e8b857"><p>NARRATOR</p></font></div>
							<p>The cracks between husband and wife deepened to a crevasse as Alexandre grew even more intolerant and short-tempered. Freya was a strong-willed, patient woman, and kept her peace until 3924, when her eldest son Geoffrey committed suicide after resigning from tribal military service. Geoffrey had always been poorly disposed to military discipline, being of a more refined intellectual temperament. His position as firstborn heir meant he had little choice but to follow a military career.</p>
							<font color="red"><p>VIDCLIP</font> - Picture of Geoffrey Alexandre Konovalev, dark and serious, holding a stiff pose in front of a turbograv fighter craft. He wears a resplendent dress uniform, but his eyes are large and haunted. His slender form is unremarkable compared with the leonine Ulysses Konovalev.</p>
							<p>At a state dinner several weeks later, the Great Eagle publicly humiliated a grieving Freya for a comment suggesting that the Blood Eagle's training customs could be reformed.</p>
							<font color="red"><p>VIDCLIP</font> - A sumptious state dinner on Outermost. Camera pans along a well-laden table. Guests wear Starwolf and Blood Eagle uniforms. The murmur of conversation blends with the clink of silverware and fine crystal. Chamber music plays in the background. Suddenly a commotion erupts from the head of the table. A voice is heard exclaiming, "No! I forbid it! Even the thought suggests treason! He was unfit, I tell you!"</p>
							<p>"Damn it, Alexandre, li-"<br>
							The camera view blurs to focus on the source of the noise and catches Alexandre as he leaps to his feet and swings his hand across Freya's face with a sharp crack. Her head snaps to one side with the force of the blow.
							Everything falls silent. The music trails off. A white-faced Freya rises slowly, her cheek flaming where her husband struck her. Alexandre glares at her, breathing hard. Without a word, she spins and leaves, pausing only to lock eyes for a moment with Ulysses, who sits at Alexandre's right hand. After a moment, her son looks away, but makes no move from his seat. Starkar Mace intercepts Freya and escorts her from the room.<p>
							<p>Camera returns to pan back along the table. The Blood Eagle remain frozen-faced. Several Starwolf are on their feet, their expressions grim, fists clenched. Someone coughs. Alexandre sits and motions for the music to resume.</p>
							<div ul style="text-align:center;"><font color="e8b857"><p>NARRATOR</p></font></div>
							<p>It was the last straw for the proud Starwolf warrior. Freya left Alexandre two days later, disappearing in the middle of the night. Ulysses remained behind. The Great Eagle was completely enraged. Accounts from anonymous court sources claim Alexandre decimated the house guard on duty the night his wife departed. These sources also claim Alexandre's mental condition took a far more bloodthirsty turn following the loss of his relationship with Freya. The great tragedy, they maintained, was that the Great Eagle truly loved his wife.</p>

							<div ul style="text-align:center;"><font color="e8b857"><p>NARRATOR</p></font></div>
							<p>One week after Freya's disappearance, Ulysses Konovalev assumed command of his father's elite Marathon Pennant to recapture his mother and return her to Outermost. In his speech to the Assembled Bloodlines of the tribe, Alexandre claimed Freya had been "taken" by Starwolf wishing to use her as a hostage against the Blood Eagle.</p>
							<font color="red"><p>VIDCLIP</font> - Alexandre stands in Court, grim and white-faced. Camera pans across a cavernous room full of uniformed officers before returning to Alexandre. The Great Eagle appears barely under control, passions raging under a thin veneer of decorum.
							"Siers, I cannot tell you how deeply this destructive act wounds the relations between our tribes. Freya Cloudchaser is my wife. She is the mother of my son. I will never surrender her to the mercies of the Starwolf…."</p>
							<div ul style="text-align:center;"><font color="e8b857"><p>NARRATOR</p></font></div>
							<p>Starkar Mace accompanied Ulysses, despite what Mace's friends described as grave misgivings. Over the next five months, the Marathon Pennant struck a series of Starwolf holdings Ulysses believed had harbored Freya. Mace objected to this course of action. He also tried to dissuade his longtime pupil from attacking Hepta Ourubis Two, as reports indicated the Hepta Ourubis Pack had pulled together a massive force. Unfortunately, Ulysses refused to listen. Though Mace remained close to his protégé, the young Konovalev, now twenty years old, had inherited his father's blind pride.</p>
							<font color="red"><p>VIDCLIP</font> - Ulysses in black and crimson Assault-class armor, inspecting a line of hardshell troops. He holds his helmet in the crook of his arm. Mace follows, also in Assault-class, his face expressionless.</p>

							<p>Cut to Ulysses as he tears down a Starwolf banner in a holdfast hall. Banner in one armored fist, he toasts toasting a mixed group of Blood Eagle knights with a goblet of wine.</p>
							<p>"So much for this group of yappers," he says with a confident grin. "Who's next?"</p>

							<p>The Hepta Ourubis Pack was formidable, led by the Warlord Nevor M'Klannin, an experienced campaigner not given to rash judgments. Despite his flair for tactics and leadership, Ulysses lacked any real combat experience and was completely outmatched. He did not take advice well.</p>

							<p>Alexandre Achilleus Konovalev spoke to no living soul for nine days. On the tenth day, he emerged from his quarters and committed the Blood Eagle to the utter destruction of the entire Starwolf tribe.</p>
							<p><font color="red">VIDCLIP</font> - Freeze frame of a wide-eyed Great Eagle standing in battle armor before the Court. His face twists in rage. He thrusts the curved blade of a khanjar into the air.</p>

							<div ul style="text-align:center;"><font color="e8b857"><p>NARRATOR</p></font></div>
							<p>Yet despite his revitalized leadership and the guidance of his brilliant generalship, Alexandre's instability finally crystallized a seed of opposition. At the end of 3926, the Commander of the Order of Wrath's elite Eviscerator Talon, which spearheaded the renewed offensive against the Starwolf, was a woman known only by her warnom: "Fury."</p>
							<p><font color="red">VIDCLIP</font> - Freeze frame of a dark woman with a patch covering one eye. She wears Scout Armor armor and crouches on the running board of a Shrike-class turbograv.</p>

							<p>She rose in rank like a comet, propelled by success after success on the battlefield. In the coming years, both her popularity among her troops and her independence from Outermost would grow.</p>
							<p><font color="red">VIDCLIP</font> - Slow zoom in to image of Fury from previous shot. She appears surprisingly young for her rank. Her expression is grave, almost sad, and the corners of her mouth are tight, as if she disapproves of having her picture taken. The patch is like a yawning hole in her face.</p>
							<div ul style="text-align:center;"><font color="e8b857"><p>NARRATOR</p></font></div>
							<p>Today she is Alexandre's chief rival, and the Blood Eagle are torn between their oaths of loyalty to a failing House on the one hand and the promise of a vigorous new leader on the other.</p>
							<p>The future of the tribe rests on how the Blood Eagle choose. Will they go to a civil war, fighting over the throne as they did following the death of Grand Master Paramount Hector Komarosu back in 3831? That conflict caused more B-E deaths than any other war in the wilderzone, and has been pointed to as the bloodiest of any tribal war.</p>
							<p>Very soon, the Blood Eagle will play out their destiny, and we shall see whether the brilliant but unstable House Konovalev can weather the storm.</p>
							<p><font color="red">VIDCLIP</font> - Close up of Alexandre followed by close up of Fury.</p>

							<div ul style="text-align:center;"><h3>Chapter 7</h3><br>
							<p><font color="e8b857">DEMON-CORE - part 3</font></p>
							<p>The time had come.</p>
							<p>Demon-Core nodded in satisfaction as he examined the hulking figures lining the assault ship's personnel bay, listened to the clack of weapon readiness, saw the gleam of light reflected from carapaces, horns, and glory plates. The grigatim had deployed into three spear-shaped craft in preparation for the attack on the Starwolf ship Retribution. This was Demon-Core's command. The invasion fleet's vanguard, of which they were a part, had dropped out of jumpthread fifteen minutes ago, disguised as Imperial trading vessels under a flag of neutrality. Each ship contained several assault craft packed with elite feroxi. Now the grigatim waited for the Steers to power the combat drives and burn for the objective.
							The feroxi musk was very strong in the cramped confines of the assault ship. Demon-Core grunted and tilted his head back and forth to loosen his neck muscles. He'd checked and rechecked his carapace to be sure the jets and shields were functioning. Both the chaingun and the plascannon he carried were in excellent working order.</p>
							<p>There was nothing left to do but wait a little longer. The killing would start soon. Urrh, but that would be good. Practicing patience had become a strain. He was eager to win more glory plates and reinforce his status as the grigatim's kill leader. He looked forward to battle again. It was what he had been bred for, after all.</p>
							<p>Of course, the human woman must be caught. Demon-Core had studied the layout of this "Retribution." It was a large ship. They would doubtless have to kill many humans while searching. He growled low in his throat, pleased at the prospect of action after so long a wait. Even shikahl had grown tiresome.</p>
							<p>"Mighty One, what are you thinking?" The Flaymaster's Inquisitor had attached itself to Demon-Core's group, a fact the Goliath greeted with a mix of elation and revulsion. Inquisitors were holy, yes, but they were also a burden. One had to protect them, and at times aggressive Inquisitors undermined a group's combat efficiency with misplaced threats or conclusions about a particular strain.
							Besides, Demon-Core hated the weak, treacherous things.</p>
							<p>He bared his teeth in greeting. "I consider the tactical situation that faces us once we come to our target."</p>
							<p>"What is your assessment?"</p>
							<p>"Urh-hah! The Starwolf do not expect us. They will be slow in their reaction. We will destroy them, for we are Strong!" Even as he said the words he knew the Inquisitor wished to hear, Demon-Core wondered why the Strong must always continue to proclaim their strength. Surely the true Strong had no need of constant boasts. It was a strange thought. Perhaps the leader of the Burning Ones was stronger than they thought.
							Apparently satisfied, the Inquisitor scuttled up to its berth. Demon-Core breathed a silent thanks to the Bloodsoul and rubbed one massive arm.
							Blood-Drinker lumbered up and locked himself into the harness at Demon-Core's left. "Hai, Demon-Core, my friend!" he rumbled happily. "Very soon now, urrh?" His harness carried a grenade launcher, a chaingun, and a spinfusor. Bulky looking to Demon-Core, but Goliaths could afford to carry extra weapons.</p>
							<p>"Arha. Very soon. How are the others?"</p>
							<p>The other Goliath shrugged. "Afraid. Why, my friend, did you pick any smaller ones to accompany us? With a go-lahk of Goliaths, we could forge ahead in glory."</p>
							<p>"We will bring much glory to the grigatim." Demon-Core squinted so that he could see his friend in the near-blackness. "The Runners bring us speed if we need it, and the Plunderer the same, but with more strength."</p>
							<p>"They are all young. Mere freshlings." Blood-Drinker sounded so mournfully doubtful that Demon-Core laughed, a sound like the grate of metal on bone.</p>
							<p>Not Khel-Har the Unstoppable! He is worth three Goliaths, urrha?"</p>
							<p>Blood-Drinker chuckled deep in his throat. "Yes, you are right. The Unstoppable is one who knows battle. Even his shadow is enough to kill a human!"</p>
							<p>Demon-Core laughed again. It was an old joke between the two of them. The Goliath they spoke of was an abnormally huge specimen, one the Inquisitors would have sent to the reclaiming vats years ago, except for two things. Khel-Har had the talent of being almost impervious to pain, even for one of the Hordes. Second, he proved exceptionally good at killing humans. Had he been smarter, he might have become a candidate for <p>Kill-Leader. However, he could not react to the unexpected as quickly as the average feroxi.</p>
							A vibration resonated through the assault craft, and Demon-Core felt a brief flash of nausea that signaled the use of acceleration dampeners.
							"We find out now whether the plan is Strong," he told Blood-Drinker. If the Starwolf were able to attack the assault ship in transit, there was nothing Demon-Core could do; it was all in the hands of the Steers.</p>
							<p>Their was a good plan, he thought, but no plan was perfect. There was evidently a tribe of humans who took pride in perfect planning, however. Demon-Core looked forward to teaching them the foolishness of such vanity.</p>
							<p>Long minutes passed.</p>
							<p>Beside him Blood-Drinker exhaled slowly. Demon-Core let his own breath escape, forcing it to be calm, even though his hearts beat fast.
							May the seed of my plasm grind the slaver filth into the dust, he recited silently. May the shadows of our past vanish like smoke in the fiery wake of our passage….</p>
							<p>Abruptly, a faint acceleration could be perceived, a low hum that increased gradually in pitch. Their commlinks hissed.
							"This is the Flaymaster. We are through the first ring of defenses, and our target lies ahead. Prepare for impact."</p>
							<p>"Come on, vatscum!" he roared. "Show these tribal humans the mercy of Horde Maul!"</p>
							<p>"For the Bloodsoul!" thundered the feroxi. Demon-Core thought he heard a note of relief in their voices. He had to admit that if he were to die, he would prefer it in direct battle, roaring and displaying his glory plates. The thought of perishing in the cold of space like a fish spilled from a broken tank unsettled him. His hearts filled with pride at the thought of going into battle with such strong companions.
							<p>His HUD flashed up a message: Impact in T minus two minutes.</p>
							Blood-Drinker leaned over and nudged him with an elbow. "My friend, I have decided we shall keep the freshlings safe while they learn strength. It is our duty as the Strong."</p>
							<p>Demon-Core began to chuckle, then he realized his friend was serious. "Don't talk like that, Blood-Drinker," he said. "There are some-" he swung his head to point his horns at the Inquisitor's nest, "-who would consider such a statement weak."</p>
							<p>"Weak? Me?" Blood-Drinker chortled. "It's a blind Inquisitor who would think that! But enough! A game, O Demon-Core, mighty Kill-Leader!"</p>
							<p>"Rrrh?"</p>
							<p>"I challenge you! Let us count our kills on this ship. The one with the lower kill number must polish the other's equipment for a week and fetch biru for him besides!"</p>
							<p>Demon-Core considered it, scraping one of his tusks with a talon. His HUD read Impact in T minus thirty seconds. "Done! I am Kill-Leader, and I will beat you in this also! But listen you: guard your great flapping tongue, urr-ha?"</p>
							<p>Blood-Drinker tapped talon to horn in mock salute. "I hear and obey, Kill-Leader!"</p>
							<p>"Good." Demon-Core clapped his friend on the shoulder and bellowed, "Brace yourselves, vatscum!" The ship would spear into the Retribution and break open at the bow so that the feroxi could pour into the Starwolf vessel. It would be a fearful impact, and not all the feroxi survived, though Demon-Core felt confident they would suffer few losses. This was a veteran grigatim. All of them had been through at least one capital ship boarding.</p>
							<p>In the dim light of the carrier bay, the feroxi tensed. Demon-Core stole a glance at the Inquisitor's nest, where the holy one crouched amid sophisticated padding that would cushion it against the crash. To his surprise, he saw the glow of the Inquisitor's gaze directed at him. For a moment, he felt great unease, wondering whether the Inquisition suspected his plasm of any flaw.
							Then he realized the Inquisitor's attention was directed at Blood-Drinker. Suddenly Demon-Core felt fear for his friend, a dark feeling that marred his excitement at the upcoming battle.</p>
							<p>T minus five seconds. Four. Three. Two. One.</p>
							<p><div ul style="text-align:center;"><font color="red">IMPACT.</font></p></div>

							<p>"You're nuts," Mace said. He shook his head. "Ymir's a deathtrap, Alyx."</p>
							<p>Alyxandra Helena Konovalev regarded him quietly, arms folded across her chest, then turned to face her brother. "What do you think, Lex?"
							Ulysses Alexandre Konovalev looked troubled as he set his coffee down. When he spoke, his words came out carefully, as if discussing these matters was a language strange to him.</p>
							<p>"I think… you've considered this whole thing carefully, but it's still basically a huge gamble." He shrugged. "Sorry. It's been a long time since I've had to think about anything other than moving rocks. I'm probably not the best qualified to offer judgment on military strategy."
							"Don't give me that," she snapped. "You were the brightest star in Outermost's academy, and your scores have never been eclipsed-"</p>
							<p>"Present company excepted," Mace cut in. "Give him a break, Alyx. He's been in limbo for almost half his life, not to mention the memory loss."</p>
							<p>Lex held up a hand. "Let be, Dad. She's right."</p>
							<p>She stiffened at the open reference to Mace's status. "I see there are no longer any secrets."</p>
							<p>"In private," Mace said. "In public he's still Alexandre's - actually, right now he's nobody. A minstrel's prentice. Regarding the relationship, though, I didn't realize it for a long time myself." He looked embarrassed. "Goes to show what you'll hide from yourself if you try hard enough."</p>
							<p>"Funny thing about memory all around," Lex continued. "Mine was gone for a long time, but what I've gotten back is so clear, it's like… like it happened yesterday. Everything. That mnemonic implanter I was stuck with gave me a lot more than-"</p>
							<p>"Lex," Mace warned.</p>
							<p>"Yeah. Right." Lex rubbed his temple and gave Fury a shaky grin. She resolved to ferret out what they'd just hidden from her, but it would wait.</p>
							<p>"Those sims you ran for us are pretty detailed," he continued. "You've thought of a lot of stuff I wouldn't have: situation-response formations, jamming salvos out the gate, remora fighter launch and mine deployment… Dark, it's a lot to absorb."</p>
							<p>"I've had a lot of time to think about it," Fury said, part of her brain filing away her brother's use of the Starwolf epithet.
							"What I want to know is why you're so convinced going to Ymir is necessary," Lex said. "If the Bloodlines are already mobilizing, isn't that enough?"</p>
							<p>Mace leaned back and blew air out his cheeks in exasperation. "Maybe not. Alexandre still rules, and nobody will move without his say-so. That it, Alyx? You want to give them something they can't ignore? Are you finally making a play for the throne?" Two gray eyes bored into her one.</p>
							<p>"I want to inspire them to act without waiting for a madman's orders." Fury met his gaze. It was difficult, matching wills with this man from her childhood, but she managed, adding, "I don't want to rule, Starkar. I hate Outermost and the backstabbing politics that infects the Court. Besides, it would trigger a true civil war, and I won't be responsible for that."</p>
							<p>"Why not?" Mace asked. "You're threatening one right now."</p>
							<p>"A false threat. I won't let it lead to bloodshed."</p>
							<p>"I don't know that it's in your hands anymore. I picked up some rumors of division in the ranks. For example, the Crimson Suns Order may declare for you openly if Eun Alba's staff can convince him to take the leap."</p>
							<p>Mace picked up his coffee and took a leisurely swig. "Tell me, Alyx: How is it you've kept your secret all these years? If the Orders knew you were Konovalev, there'd be a lot of support for placing you on the throne."</p>
							<p>Fury took a sip from her mug of tea before answering. "First tell me how you guessed," she said. "It's not common knowledge, to say the least, and I don't have the same face you knew me by."</p>
							<p>"No special brilliance on my part, I'm afraid." Mace laughed and put the mug down. "Old Starkweather and I were good friends, you might recall. I kept in touch off and on over the years, and he tipped me off when I sent word to him about returning to B-E space. Said you'd done him proud."</p>
							<p>"I'll roast him," she said without rancor. "We worked damned hard to make the cover and make sure it stuck." Lex looked completely lost, so she decided to explain. "You know I was fostered with the Starkweathers. Shortly after you were lost, there was an assassination attempt. I was the target. Somebody tried to leave the tribe without an heir." She rubbed her eye patch uneasily. "Obviously, they failed, but we decided to put out that they'd succeeded."</p>
							<p>"Why?" Lex asked.</p>
							<p>"The assassin was good, too good. Brilliant, in fact, and so highly trained it's a miracle I made it out alive. We still can't tell you where he came from, but it wasn't Cardinal Spear, and I don't think it was the Empire. We didn't get a chance to interrogate him, either."
							"Like Nagashima back when," Mace said.</p>
							<p>"Exactly."</p>
							<p>"How'd you make it, if he was so good?" Lex prompted.</p>
							<p>"That's my secret," she said.</p>
							<p>"Good enough," Mace said. Lex nodded, and Fury continued.</p>
							<p>"We provided a body with the appropriate injuries, and I went through surgery to alter my features, my voice, and my geneprint. Afterwards, Starkweather put me into his forces as an orphan, an obscure ward of the Bloodline whose parents were killed in '15. My history is sketchy, and I'm listed as six years older than I am. There are a few other details to make it stick, but essentially I'm supposed to be from nobody stock."
							<p>"And Cardinal Spear bought it?" Mace asked. "Alexandre didn't throw a fit?"</p>
							Fury smiled. "My idea. The assassin did hit someone, you see. Starkweather's niece Fienna. She lived, but in a permanent coma. We altered her to look like me and sent her 'home' to Outermost." She stared at the table, a lump suddenly in her throat. "Father had her killed within a week. Nobody mentions my-her-name at Court. Or anywhere." Old memories flooded her, and she didn't know how to handle them. These two men brought back so much she'd buried. She drew a deep breath and looked up. Lex had a troubled expression on his face, almost a guilty one. Mace reached out and squeezed her arm.</p>
							<p>"Alyxandra Helena Konovalev has been dead for fifteen years. She doesn't exist." She steeled her voice. "There's only Fury. And I have earned my rank." Lex froze at the last sentence. She'd said it sharply, but he needed to know how things stood with her, what she valued. "I think the question here is: what now? Do you plan to return to Outermost, brother?"</p>
							<p>He stared at his fists for a long moment. When he answered, his voice was soft but determined. "No. I've been… away… for a long time. A thrall. It wouldn't be smart right now. I'm not qualified to take up where I left off. And I don't think I want to. I'm not the same person I was, memories or not."</p>
							<p>"You're a powerful symbol, son," Mace said. "People have already seen you and made guesses. Rumors have started."</p>
							<p>"Just guesses, just rumors." Lex raised his head and turned his full attention to Fury. "I want to go with you, Alyx. To Ymir."</p>
							<p>"Oh, Christ and Hunter." Mace thumped the table. "Not you, too. Is having a death wish a family trait?"</p>
							<p>Fury sat back and scrutinized her brother. He was sincere, she realized. Completely sincere. He'd never been adept at deception. Not like a full Konovalev, she thought bitterly. Not like her.</p>
							<p>"You're the heir to the Exiled Bloodlines, like it or not," she said. "How can I take you into a 'deathtrap' when you may offer a peaceful succession to the tribe? Give me a compelling reason, Lex. Otherwise, you stay here out of the line of fire." Out of the corner of her eye, she saw Mace nod in agreement.</p>
							<p>Lex leaned toward her, blue eyes ablaze. Uncertainty fell away from him like a cloak. In that moment, she saw her mother's features and Mace's blended so strongly that she wondered how anyone could ever have believed a drop of Konovalev blood ran through this man's veins.</p>
							<p>"So I can earn my rank, Sirdar-Prime," he said.</p>

								<h2>Ursula</h2>
							</header>

							<p>It would begin soon. Ursula couldn't wait. The desire for blood thrummed in her muscles, a murderous need that burned away the edge of reason.</p>
							<p>The Blood Eagle prisoners stood stoically on the other side of the dropship bay, their scarlet and silver armors gleaming under the harsh lights. One was a confident young man of impressive physique, the other an older woman with a scarred face who met Ursula's gaze with an appraising one of her own. It was she who would be the real challenge, not the stripling.</p>
							<p>"Don't do this, Ursa-it's a fool's game," her husband Kalamon murmured over the commlink. "For the love of Wolf, call it off."</p>
							<p>By the Great Bitch, didn't he understand? "Kal, this isn't <a href="4_2_08_renn.html">the damned Firetruce</a>, so shut up! Or I'll have you down on Ymir teaching newbloods how to dig ice trenches!"</p>
							<p>"You are the Law, Ur-Warlord," he answered stiffly. She heard the hurt and anger in his voice, but it didn't matter. The butchers <a href="4_2_06_laram.html">had tortured her only son to death</a>! Her son! The only thing they hadn't defiled with their knives was his face, but even that had frozen in lines of agony. She saw it every time she closed her eyes. Her boy. Carved up like a kraalbeest. There were no tears left now, only rage.</p>
							<p>She stepped forward and addressed her two opponents. They wore light Scout Armor armors without helmets, as did she. The only weapons were long knives and the armors themselves. Ursula clenched and unclenched her fist, felt the soft click of the armor's microservos that augmented her strength. She was ready. Her pulse thundered.</p>
							<p>"Hear me, scrof! I am Ursula DiVaragas, warnom 'Slasher,' Ur-Warlord of the Starwolf, Leader of the Ten Thousand Knives of the Great Muster! Your kin killed my son! I claim blood-right to your lives, and the lives of all your tribe!" She threw her hands wide. "You know the terms: to the death! You win, you get freedom and passage home. I win... your carcasses go into space with the garbage."</p>
							<p>The young butcher shifted uncomfortably. The scarred woman spat. "You expect us to believe your promises, yapper?" she said.</p>
							<p>"You get a better chance than you gave my son!" Ursula snapped, the rage roaring up in her like a black wave.</p>
							<p>"Begin," came Kal's voice over the intercom, flat with disapproval. All three combatants blurred into motion. Ursula went for the woman first. The boy was barely past newblood, not a serious threat; he'd try to distract Ursula while the real killer moved in. She triggered her jets and hurled herself across the open bay.</p>
							<p>The boy tried to body-block her, but he was clumsy. She twisted aside in mid-air and drove her forearm down to deflect his hurtling body with a clang, sparks flashing where the armors touched. She landed in a crouch, the boy off somewhere behind and to the right, the butcher woman coming down in a jet-assisted spin kick aimed at Ursula's unprotected head.</p>
							<p>Bracing herself, Ursula crossed both arms in a high block to trap the other's leg, but the woman pulled the kick at the last moment, instead twisting to plant that foot on the deck and lash out in a low back kicking sweep with the other. Fast as she was, Ursula was faster, driven by sheer rage. She dove over the Blood Eagle's shoulder and slashed the woman's face open from nose to cheek to jaw, the knife tip trailing crimson in its wake. Ursula jerked her head aside and felt a razor pain in her ear, followed by something wet on her neck. The Blood Eagle grunted and leaped back, one hand covering her bloody face. Ursula heard herself laugh, shrill and tight.</p>
							<p>A shush of jets warned her the boy was jetting back, again too recklessly. Ursula feinted forward toward the woman, then dodged to the side and buried her blade backhanded in the boy's throat, the blow's force aggravated by his own momentum and driving the parasteel into his chest past the hilt. She didn't have time to savor his death. The Blood Eagle woman counterattacked, and Ursula had to retreat without her weapon. She circled and parried with her arms, waiting for the face wound to take its toll on her enemy.</p>
							<p>It wasn't easy. The butcher woman was good enough to give Ursula a few near brushes with death. In the end, though, the butcher simply couldn't breathe well enough with all the blood clogging her nose and throat. Within a few minutes, she faltered and left herself open.</p>
							<p>"God curse all yappers," she managed to blurt before Ursula broke her neck with a lunging palm strike to the face.</p>
							<p>Ursula took a few deep breaths as the rage ebbed. She felt no sense of victory. The hold smelled of recycled air and blood. She looked at the bodies and was surprised to feel tears streaming down her face. Tears! She'd thought she was done with weeping. It wouldn't bring Laram back, but maybe.... She choked out a sob. Great Wolf...! <a href="4_2_04_fury.html">Maybe if she killed enough</a> of these bloody-handed, murderous scrof... maybe every last hunchin' one....</p>
							<p>Maybe then she'd be able to cry enough for her son.</p>
							<p>She pulled herself together. She was the leader of the Starwolf Muster and could not show weakness. "Kal," she said in a husky voice, "space this trash, will you?" She wiped her face on her arm and headed for the freshers, blood dripping from her hands.</p>
							<p>It was a beginning.</p>

								<h2>Renn</h2>
							</header>
							
							<p>The pain was a constant companion. It ebbed and flowed through all his waking hours, and it tormented his sleep. He had schooled himself to betray no outward hint of it, but the attacks grew sharper each day, and he doubted his strength would last indefinitely. Now thousands of eyes would be on him. He must not falter.</p>
							<p>Renn Gistos yl-Harabec, Phoenix Prime, High Warden of the Wing of Glory, Keeper of the Holy Word, and Scion of the First Tribe, stepped out of the shuttle and breathed the tepid morning air of Bella Omega, site of the Seventh Firetruce. It was only a short time since the sun rose, but he could already taste the humidity that promised to become a sweltering heat before midmorning. When one had walked on over a hundred worlds, one developed a keen nose for climate. Still, it was beautiful and lush with vegetation. He approved of the Diamond Sword's choice.</p>
							<p>A spasm flared up like lightning ripping through his vitals. He masked the sudden agony by pausing as though he merely surveyed his surroundings, though anyone close to him would have remarked on the sudden rigidity of his posture. When it passed-thank the Lord Phoenix it was not one of his longer attacks, for he could not afford to show weakness-he made his way carefully down the steps.</p>
							<p>A small delegation waited below him, accompanied by an honor guard of Diamond Sword Assault-classs whose armor flashed in the sunlight. Other Diamond Sword stood guard on the buildings around the landing zone, alongside the glittering gold armors of Children of Phoenix warriors. A riot of fiery orange and scarlet flowers cascaded from the terraced buildings, and multicolored banners stirred in the morning breeze. The sight was sweet and fresh, like hope on the wing. Renn let the brightness fill his heart.</p>
							<p>An attractive young woman stepped out of the delegation to greet him. She wore enameled white armor emblazoned with a purple thunderbolt. So this is the girl chosen as Speaker of the Firetruce Council! She was much younger than he'd expected, though he'd known she was a junior officer from an independent tribe that followed a version of his own faith in the Phoenix. Why did the Diamond Sword choose her? he wondered. She didn't strike him as a conspirator. The girl had an appraising expression, and he saw the lines of strain on her face.</p>
							<p>Suddenly he knew <a href="4_2_09_triad.html">why the Diamond Sword had placed her here</a>. She is too new to this game. With the insight came a rush of pity for her. Welcome to the world of politics, child. May it not destroy you… as it has me.</p>
							<p>"Greetings, Light of the First Tribe," she said with a deep bow. "I am Shana Dawn Terayl of the Sons of Thunder, warnom Nabterayl. Welcome to Bella Omega."</p>
							<p>Renn smiled and strode down to place his hand on her shoulder. The moment his armored boots touched the tarmac he knew this world would be the death of him. "Bright Lord Harabec!"</p>
							<p>The girl looked alarmed. "My Lord Gistos?"</p>
							<p>"It's nothing." Renn forced a reassuring smile. "My thanks for your welcome, Shana Dawn Terayl. The Bright Lord bless and watch over you." She looked doubtful for an instant, but she covered it with a brilliant smile that seemed to throw cares to the wind. Ah, would that he were fifty years younger! He'd have courted this girl then, by the Bright Lord, yes. His smile became a genuine grin. Ah, Renn, still distracted by pretty faces after all these years…!</p>
							<p>The pain threatened to return, but he took a deep breath and willed it away. The feeling of malice still pervaded his inner senses. I've come a long way, planet. I've sweated and sacrificed to be here at this moment. You'll not defeat my purpose, by Blessed Harabec. He had at least three months before the alien cancer devoured him. He would put them to good use. Thus far, no one but his physician knew the truth: he was dying.</p>
							<p>Even your life is a weapon, the Scriptures taught.</p>
							<p>He returned his attention to business. If Terayl was brightly clad, her companion was her opposite. Tall, deathly pale, and encased in black armor, a familiar figure knelt before Renn.</p>
							<p>"My Great Lord," the woman said in a honeyed voice. "My life is yours." </p>
							<p>"My Lady Lilith." He placed his hand on her hair. "It is good to see the Keeper of the Flame at the Firetruce." Malderi's tool, he thought dryly. Never believe otherwise of this serpent. Anton Malderi had long hungered for the throne of the Phoenix Prime, he and his bloodthirsty Harbinger faction. There would be much blood spilled if Malderi came to power, Renn knew.</p>
							<p>Lilith stood, a half-smile playing at her lips. "As it is good to see the Word of the Bright Lord, whose presence brings light to each world he treads upon."</p>
							<p>Beautiful and fey, that was Lilith. The leader of the fanatical Dark Phoenix Wing, she burned with the intensity of her faith. A pity that she had fallen under Malderi's shadow, and thereby the shadow of the Other.</p>
							<p>Renn turned to the Thunder girl. The <a href="4_2_05_ghost.html">Speaker of the Council</a>, he reminded himself. He would not treat her as a child. She deserved respect from him, even as he-like the others-deceived and manipulated her.</p>
							<p>"Shana Dawn Terayl, if you would lead me to my chambers, I shall rest awhile before the opening ceremonies."</p>
							<p>"Of course, my Lord. If you will follow me?"</p>
							<p>He fell in behind her, grimacing inwardly at the pain that snaked tendils up from his gut. If he was to die here, he would have to ensure his death furthered his purpose.</p>
							<p>Unity. Yes, that was a goal worth any price.</p>
							<p>He looked at the back of the young Speaker. Unity was worth even the death of children, the destruction of innocence. Try as he might, he could not see an alternative. His dream was a bloody one, but he would pay the price as fully as he could. With every step he welcomed the pain as his penance. There would be no drugs, he vowed. No relief, for however many days or weeks the Bright Lord permitted him.</p>
							<p>He would drink fully of the cup of sacrifice.</p>

								<h2>Demon Core</h2>
							</header>
														
							<p>Arahk Gahl the Demon-Core scratched the tip of a talon against the ceraplas glory plate fused into his shoulder and daydreamed of dismembering humans. They were so soft and weak, it would have been pitiful had his instincts embraced pity. Rrrh, he understood the concept from his training in human psychology, but it was foreign to his thinking. Weak. The Slonn had bred out such retrogressive feelings.</p>
							<p>Around him his brothers crouched in the dropship hold. He smelled their musk and his heart swelled. They were an entire gregatim of Horde Maul's elite ferox reavers, the Strongest of the Strong, the spearhead of a great force travelling deep into the Hyperweb to eradicate the human maggots clinging to the back end of the galaxy. Demon-Core growled softly in anticipation. The slaughter would be very great. It would be a challenge to keep his position as the grigatim's leader in the number of kills. Prospects were bloody and bright.</p>
							<p>It was not always so. Once his entire race had been slaves, animals in thrall to the soft humans. The BioDerms fought and died at human pleasure. They served, and even their plasm was in thrall to human biomanipulation. Then the Great One had risen, the Chainbreaker, a mutant BioDerm with the strength to shatter the human chains and free his people.</p>
							<p>"I hear these humans are pided," muttered Grall Durgohlak, crouched to Demon-Core's right. "But I hear they are not like the Imperials. Hrah! They are strong, I hear, especially the <a href="4_2_07_naj.html">ones who wear the Red Bird.</a>" Grall was a Runner, bred for speed and agility.</p>
							<p>Demon-Core lashed out with a massive fist, smashing the lighter BioDerm to the floor. "They are not as strong as we are, Grall! Do not breed fear in the gregatim!"</p>
							<p>Grall lay stunned, a shadow in the dim light of the hold. Chuckling deep in his throat, Rog Gedharhk Blood-Drinker hauled the smaller reaver up and slammed him back in his place. Blood-Drinker was a Goliath like Demon-Core, the heaviest of the reaver breeds.</p>
							<p>The Goliath turned a huge head toward Demon-Core, the chipped horns carved with numerous kill marks. "The little one meant no harm, brother. He looks forward to these little 'tribes,' rrrh? They will test our strength."</p>
							<p>Demon-Core nodded reluctantly. He had smelled a trace of fear on Grall, but the Runner would be tested against the humans. If he survived but was unfit, the Inquisition would send him to the vats for recycling.</p>
							<p>He himself was eager. He enjoyed the feel of his armored carapace, as well as the thought of the mobility its jets would give him. The reavers had adopted the tactics and equipment of the "Tribes of Man," copying such things as their mobile armors, though without the strength augmentation. No reaver would dare admit his own body was not sufficiently powerful to accomplish what was needed.</p>
							<p>He hefted a massive plasma gun copied from the latest tribal arsenals, approving of its solidity and capacity for destruction. The human targets he'd tested it on simply vaporized if hit directly. If not hit directly, rrrh, there were burnt parts left over, that was all. An enjoyable piece of hardware, yessss…. It would not be properly broken in until he had washed it in the blood of these Starwolf.</p>
							<p>The Flaymaster, a beautiful specimen of the Plunderer breed, had briefed the grigatim earlier. She explained how they <a href="4_2_02_brianna.html">would fight humans called the Starwolf</a> on a cold planet called Ymir. She said the humans were assembled there in great numbers for a war of their own, but that they did not expect to be attacked. They knew this because a human traitor gave them the data.</p>
							<p>Humans were always treacherous, she told them. They had no Inquisition to keep their genes uncorrupted. After the Starwolf fell, there would be others. Many of the humans were meeting to talk about peace, but the <a href="4_2_08_renn.html">leader of their strongest tribe</a>, the Burning Ones, was old and weak, and his juices were dried up. He would lead no more.</p>
							<p>This announcement caused much hilarity. After the laughter had died down at the thought of such a husk leading fighters, she continued. The fourth tribe, the Sword, had retreated to their hidden cities, so they would be the last to fall. It would be like rooting out worms, scut work for the lesser Hordes. Horde Maul had been given the pride of first blood, by the Bloodsoul, and the Flaymaster expected her feroxi to earn many glory plates and take much plasm! Her Inquisitor would keep the body count, she said. That was all.</p>
							<p>The Flaymaster's Inquisitor, a thin, spidery creature that bristled with various cybernetic injectors and genesniffers, had followed her briefing with the customary warnings about weakness. Then it listed several traits it desired to find among these tribal humans, qualities of strength and durability that could be added to the Core Plasm.</p>
							<p>Despite their holy role and the rightness of their task, Demon-Core hated Inquisitors. They themselves were not Strong. They served the Strong. Rrrh, but only the great Overlord was spared their probes and demands for tissue samples. Deep in his heart, Demon-Core knew he also feared the Inquisitors. They could unmake any of the Strong with their judgments.</p>
							<p>They would not unmake him. He was Strong and had always been so. He clenched a massive fist and prayed silently to the Bloodsoul: <i>May the seed of my plasm grind the slaver filth into the dust. May the shadows of our past vanish like smoke in the fiery wake of our passage and our vats spawn only blameless plasm. May a thousand suns shine on freedom for the Chainless, for the Chainless are the Strong who shall grasp the future and make it their own.</i></p>
							<p><i>I am of the Chainless. I am of the Strong. I shall burn the slaver filth where I find them.</i></p>
							<p><i>I shall show no mercy.</i></p>

								<h2>Brianna</h2>
							</header>
							<p>My name is Brianna Meranda Kenzie of the Narhaven Kenzies. I come from a fringe planet on the outer rim of the wilderzone, a cold but beautiful place. Last year my family was wiped out by a Griever attack, leaving me alive with nothing but painful memories and a whole lot of survivor's guilt. I didn't want to hang around moping and lapping up little scraps of pity from my holdfast neighbors, so I joined Ur-Warlord DiVaragas's call to fight the Blood Eagle. See new worlds, fight the bad guys, that sort of thing. That's how I ended up on the world of Ymir, a newblood with nothing to call her own but her armor, a blaster, and an old spinfusor that had belonged to my brother.</p>
							<p>Ymir was a totally new experience for me. There were so many other people, more than I'd ever seen in one place before, that I had a hard time fitting in. Still, I tried, and I thought I'd been doing OK.</p>
							<p>Until I met the Blood Eagle, anyway.</p>
							<p>If I hadn't smiled at the wrong time in front of the wrong person, life would have been a whole lot easier. Or maybe not. Lachris would probably still have found an excuse to go after me. Some people just need enemies, I guess.</p>
							<p>I was in a cadre of newbloods headed out to a perimeter base for training exercises. Two Turbograv Personnel Carriers carried the eight of us. Our trainer was a grim-faced Sergeant we'd met only that morning. He hadn't said much, just ordered us into the T-gravs before climbing into the tailgunner slot on one carrier and nursing a sipcup. Our pilots hugged the ice as we left town so as not to burden air traffic control further. Shuttles were going around the clock, ferrying goods and troops between planet and orbit. Rumors said this was the largest muster in the tribe's history. We were going to take out the Eagle once and for all, but we had to <a href="4_2_04_fury.html">go through Fury</a> first. She was supposed to be a real ogre, so the Ur-Warlord wasn't taking any chances.</p>
							<p>I took a deep breath and tried to enjoy the ride. Ymir was the kind of world only a Starwolf could appreciate. Glaciers everywhere except for huge lichen-blanketed reefs sticking out here and there. Some of the reefs were supposedly giant mountains of frozen salt. Underneath everything was a deep salt water ocean. Things swam around down there, the locals said, monster predators like razor hags and jotunfish. The snowy heights reminded me of Narhaven, even though the sky was different, there were no forests, and a salt tang filled my nose no matter where I went. It made me homesick somehow, but I didn't have anything to go back home to, not since the Grievers killed my family and blasted my holdfast to rubble.</p>
							<p>The sky was dark with clouds. I leaned into the harness that held me in the carrier and focused on the day ahead. I'd fought the Griever raiders back home, but we were shipping out to face the Blood Eagle soon, so we had to be ready. The Blood Eagle were another level of threat entirely.</p>
							<p>"Hey, check out the butchers!" a loud voice cut in across my private channel. It was Lachris Tremane, the big blond fem from Priam III who'd grabbed the leadership role in our cadre. She stood next to me in the other starboard carrier slot, pointing at a group of laborers up ahead. "See the Assault-class standing sentry? Those are Blood Eagle prisoners, Kenzie," she continued. "Hope the bastards freeze their tattoos off out here. It's a waste of effort to keep them alive."</p>
							<p>The prisoners were working hard cutting and loading blocks of ice, so they were probably keeping warm enough. A Assault-class with a chaingun stood nearby on a block of ice. I could see the restraint collars on the prisoners. Lachris and the others made catcalls and obscene gestures as we passed. I just hung on and took a good look. I was curious; I'd never seen any Blood Eagle before.</p>
							<p>They were a lot like us, only with darker skin and hair. Not the blood-covered berserkers I'd heard tales about. <a href="4_2_07_naj.html">One guy in particular caught my eye</a>. He actually stood and bowed as we passed, a devil-may-care grin on his face. Not what I'd expected from what I'd heard of the butchers. I hit my visor's zoom for a closer look as we sped off. He definitely wasn't bad-looking, and I was surprised to see he wasn't much older than me. Light brown skin, beautiful green eyes, a crew cut so short his hair was a shadow on his scalp, pierced ears with empty holes where earrings had been. He watched us go with that lopsided grin lingering on his face. Actually, he looked right at me. Me! My heart sped up. Despite myself, I grinned back. It'd be easy to get lost in those eyes.</p>
							<p>"Like what you see, Kenzie?" My reaction hadn't escaped Lachris, and she sounded like she'd just turned over a rock and found a nest of chig-slithies. I turned off my zoom.</p>
							<p>"Just curious," I stammered, trying to look nonchalant. I could feel the blush creeping up my face, though. I wasn't fooling her.</p>
							<p>She banged an armored hand on the carrier plating in mock alarm. "Ohhhh, dear! Brianna Kenzie's found a butcher boyfriend!" The other newbloods laughed. I looked up at the sergeant, but he wasn't paying attention. I wasn't going to run to him for help, anyway.</p>
							<p>"I hear they bite your tongue off when they kiss, Kenzie!" chimed in Tevyan Biragan, a stocky boy who made no secret about being smitten with Lachris. He practically yapped when she talked to him. "Be sure and report back to us, aiya?" he added.</p>
							<p>"Wonder <a href="4_2_10_paragas.html">what Ur-Warlord DiVaragas would say</a> if she knew about your crush on a butcher?" someone else yelled.</p>
							<p>Led by Lachris, others jumped in with additional jabs. I tried to laugh with them, but the teasing really hurt, especially the stuff Lachris said. Her family was rich and famous, people talked all the time about how good a warrior she was, and she looked like a hero from the vids. Tall and muscular, she was also gifted with a large chest and holostar features. All the males in Skyrholm turned their heads when she passed by. I, on the other hand, looked like a gangly kitten next to her. I didn't have enough chest to notice when I wore armor. Not that it should matter, but I was seventeen and I wanted Lachris to like me. Right now she kept ragging me about the Eagle, so it didn't take long for me to start wishing I'd shot the scrof instead of returning his damn smile.</p>
							<p>Fortunately, when our pilot took us upstairs, everybody laid off. We were a kilometer out of town, and the view was spectacular. Skyrholm Holdfast and its crowded fraytown faded quickly behind us.</p>
							<p>It didn't take long to get to the training area, a rock-studded, hilly place in the glacier where floating grav platforms and thick ice columns encircled a moderately-sized base. A small pyramid floated directly over the base, and a narrow beam of light ran from the bottom of the pyramid to the flat base summit. I wondered what it was. Some kind of beacon? We landed and lined up next to the foot of the base. The Sergeant came down the line for a cursory inspection. Then he jetted up onto a platform about three meters over the ground.</p>
							<p>"Alright, newbloods!" he called. "Pay attention! Today you get to demonstrate situational awareness and agility, not teamwork. This exercise is called Hunter. High scores get first crack at command in your cadre, low scores get clean-up duty in the mess tonight. Understood? I hear only one of you has seen live combat." He turned toward me. "You go easy on these punks, Kenzie." Then he gave me a thumbs-up sign!</p>
							<p>I swallowed in disbelief. He just made me the number one target! I'd practiced a lot back home on Narhaven, but mostly cooperative fire team simulations, not solo. I glanced at Lachris. She was watching me with a tight little frown. Some of the others darted their eyes my way as well. I made a show of examining my weapon, hoping to look nonchalant, but my heart was pounding.</p>
							<p>Why did he single me out like that? It wasn't fair!</p>
							<p>Lachris leaned over. "May the best warrior win… Eagle-lover." She flashed a friendly smile like it was all a joke, but her eyes were colder than Ymir's glaciers, and I knew this wasn't just an exercise any longer.</p>

								<h2>Fury</h2>
							</header>
							
							<p>The confrontation promised to be interesting. The woman known as Fury wondered whether Alexandre had hand-picked his emissary to provoke her. DeBures was certainly arrogant enough. Arrogant and blind. His assassins had been clumsy; she hadn't even been marked. Surely there were <a href="4_2_05_ghost.html">better tools</a> at the Great Eagle's hand.</p>
							<p>Keeping her face carefully neutral, Fury stepped into her briefing room on the Blood Eagle battleship Gladius Dei. The Circle of Fire-her name for her staff of oath-sworn advisors-rose as a man and saluted. One figure remained seated, an action clearly meant to be an insult, a message that she was not worthy of the rank she held. The Great Eagle's emissary, Pennant-Commander Ram DeBures, was a gray-haired war dog with a neck as stiff as the pikes he'd stuck his enemies' heads on. His arms folded across his massive chest, and his face held a barely-veiled expression of anger and surprise.</p>
							<p>At first glance, she knew she looked unimposing next to a warrior like DeBures. A slender woman of indeterminate age, she wore her brown hair in a simple crew cut. No one would call her beautiful, but neither was she unattractive. Her skin was dark enough to suggest her ancestors had lived in sunny climes, but light enough to prevent an accurate assessment of her ethnic heritage. Her one memorable physical attribute was her single piercing blue eye. The other one had been lost in a duel with a Phoenix Lord during her youth. Eschewing any form of replacement, she covered the socket with a garnet-studded patch of leather made from the Phoenix Lord's manhood. Her uniform was a simple black one with a crimson sash. The only signs of her rank were the delicate gold eagles pinned to her collar and the ebon swagger stick she carried tucked under one arm. Unimposing, yes, but only on the surface.</p>
							<p>She met the hostile stare of the Great Eagle's dog with a thin smile. She had already decided to how she would deal with him. The Bloodline DeBures prided themselves on adhering to the deepest tradition of honor with a capital "H." He was a dinosaur so far as she was concerned, worthless except for one thing: obeying his master. Still, he had potential. She planned to teach this old dog a new trick.</p>
							<p>She seated herself and turned to her right, away from DeBures. "Narr-Captain Chalad. Report."</p>
							<p>A powerfully-built woman who carried numerous scarred tattoos on her face, Chalad had a reputation for self-discipline almost as great as Fury's. She tapped a button on her bodycomp, and a hologram of a dusty brown planet appeared above the table. "Sirdar-Prime. We have debriefed all survivors from Shek Two. The yappers hit the Chapters with overwhelming force, at least forty thousand warriors." Red and green triangles winked onto the planetary surface. The red triangles were legion, the green ones mere speckles in comparison. Chalad's voice remained emotionless. "Nine Swords remained to cover the evacuation from the main Chapterhouse, but it was hopeless. No one made it to the pickup, though we understand the <a href="4_2_07_naj.html">yappers took some prisoners</a>. Other casualties were minimal."</p>
							<p>Fury nodded. "Thank you. Sikkyn-Captain Sevaya. Rep-"</p>
							<p>DeBures interrupted, his voice deep and gravelly. "Sirdar, I-"</p>
							<p>"Sirdar-Prime, Sier," Fury corrected him icily.</p>
							<p>DeBures shrugged impatiently. "Sirdar-Prime, then. Why did you garrison Shekerik Two with so few? With the forces you have here, you could easily have mounted a more effective defense. Is this the way you shepherd the worlds under the Great Eagle's wings?"</p>
							<p>She turned again to Sevaya. "Sikkyn-Captain, explain matters to the Commander."</p>
							<p>Sevaya jabbed at his bodycomp. The hologram changed to show a green and verdant world, the one that spun five hundred kilometers below them: Charybdis.</p>
							<p>"Sier DeBures," he began, "we have deployed the entire assets of the Order of Wrath together with the assets of the allied independents who sent aid. Despite over thirty thousand hard-shell troops and twenty thousand soft-shells, we lack the strength to hold the world. <a href="4_2_10_paragas.html">DiVaragas has nursed a bloodfeud</a> against us for many years, and she has now succeeded in mustering nearly the entire Starwolf tribe for a long-term offensive. We believe she has assembled over ten Thousand-Knives at Ymir, and troops continue to arrive from the Fringe and from the Starwolf's tribal allies. Their troop numbers surpass one hundred sixty thousand hard-shells according to our best estimates. We don't have an accurate figure on soft-shells, but I believe they can field at least fifty thousand."</p>
							<p>"Raw God," DeBures grated. Just for a moment he looked shaken, then he slipped back behind the hardened demeanor he had worn since his arrival. "Surely the Diamond Sword and the Children of Phoenix would never allow such a threat to the balance of power… unless they have changed their spots."</p>
							<p>Good, Fury thought. The dog begins to learn.</p>
							<p>"Thank you, Sikkyn-Captain." She looked at DeBures. "We obtained this information from intelligence assets on Shekerik Two. We left units in position to support our agents and to draw out DiVaragas so we could analyze the composition of her force and strategy." She steepled her fingers on the table. "Now, my Lord, as to your embassy. I requested assistance from the Great Eagle and the Exiled Bloodlines some time ago. I presume you bring me an answer."</p>
							<p>DeBures frowned. "I was commanded to speak to you alone, Lady."</p>
							<p>"Speak freely in front of my staff, or not at all." Her tone remained soft, but brooked no argument.</p>
							<p>"If I must." He cleared his throat. "Greetings with honor to Sirdar Fury of the Order of Wrath. The Great Eagle commands you to return at once to Court at Outermost and explain your disobedience. Your troops will stand down while the Orders of the Black Star and Burning Steel assume command responsibilities on Charybdis."</p>
							<p>The air in the room seemed to thicken. Someone coughed, and Fury heard Chalad whisper a profanity.</p>
							<p>"And if I refuse, Sier DeBures?" she asked quietly.</p>
							<p>"In that case, Sirdar, the Great Eagle declares you Traitor and Infidel. The other Orders will hunt you, Cardinal Spear will seek the lives of you and your blood relations, and any of your officer cadre who do not repudiate you will share your fate."</p>
							<p>"I see. Regrettably, I refuse."</p>
							<p>That caught him off-guard. The DeBures could never imagine disobedience, she thought wryly. Their rigid code of honor smothered independent thought.</p>
							<p>"You're insane!" he said.</p>
							<p>"No, my Lord, that would be the Great Eagle."</p>
							<p>"You condemn us to another civil war, by Christ and Holy Hunter!"</p>
							<p>"So be it." She looked around the table. "There is no time for political games, Siers. The wolf is at our door and it will not wait for us to settle our differences. Any of you who wish to accept the Great Eagle's terms are free to do so."</p>
							<p>No one moved. She studied each face and nodded in approval. She hadn't expected anything else. "Excellent. Pass the word down the chain of command. The offer holds for everyone, so long as any takers depart within twenty four hours standard." Sevaya saluted and left the room with a grim expression on his face.</p>
							<p>DeBures jumped to his feet, red with anger. "I shall take your answer back to Court, madam. Perhaps we'll meet again when I return to take your head." Her staff members also jumped up at this, hands flying to weapons.</p>
							<p>She rose slowly and caught DeBures's gaze with her own, her temper flowing into her words like a river of ice. "Sier DeBures, I had hoped you would take word of our situation back to the Exiled Houses and bend your efforts to assisting us, but I see you persist in habits of blind obedience. Your assassins are dead. I am alive." She waited for that to sink in before continuing, "Whether Providence is with us or not, I will do whatever is necessary to protect the tribe. I will sacrifice every last soldier here-including me-to keep the Starwolf from overrunning our entire nation. If that means defying the Great Eagle, so be it."</p>
							<p>"But... but this defiance dishonors you!"</p>
							<p>She laughed coldly. "And your point? Christ and Hunter, this is war, DeBures, not some pissant raid where everyone dances to the Tenets! We are not the Children of Phoenix, and this is not <a href="4_2_08_renn.html">the bloody Firetruce!</a> DiVaragas hates our guts, Sier, and she prepares to attack us with better than four to one odds! You're an idiot if you believe she tempers her decisions with honor."</p>
							<p>"Take him," she ordered. Chalad and two others were ready and seized DeBures instantly.</p>
							<p>"This is an outrage, by God! I came under flag of truce!" DeBures bellowed, struggling as his captors bound his hands.</p>
							<p>"They were your assassins, Sier DeBures," Fury observed.</p>
							<p>He drew himself up. "I will endure your knives bravely, traitor. I won't give you the satisfaction of hearing me beg for my life."</p>
							<p>Fury laughed. "Raw God, man, killing you would be a waste! You're going planetside to command a Sword in service of the tribe. We'll put the word out that I've convinced you to go rogue with me. Who knows? We might have more assistance that way. If nothing else, the Great Eagle's trust in the House of DeBures will be diminished."</p>
							<p>"What makes you think I'll fight for you?" he demanded.</p>
							<p>"Why, Sier, you're a man of honor. You won't fight for me, but you'll damn well fight against the Starwolf when they come. I know you that well, at least."</p>
							<p>Speechless, he simply glared at her, hatred blazing in his eyes. She waved her stick. "Get him out of my sight, Chalad. The rest of you are dismissed with my thanks." The dog will learn the rest of his lesson on Charybdis. Honor won't shield us when DiVaragas comes.</p>
							<p>After everyone had left, she returned to her seat and examined the hologram of Charybdis. There was no way out. Only when she was completely alone could she let herself feel the enormity of that simple fact. Without the other Orders supporting her, the yappers would crush her forces like a dry nut in an industrial vice. After a time, she carefully turned off the display and the lights, put her head in her hands, and wept.</p>
							<p>The brave speech she had given DeBures was only partly true; though she spurned the tribal notion of honor, she did believe in duty and responsibility. Fifty thousand troops and untold numbers of civilians were going to die on her watch, and there was nothing she could do to prevent it.</p>
							<p>What could possibly make the Great Eagle so complacent?</p>

								<h2>Ghost</h2>
							</header>
							
							<p>The assassin prided himself on being invisible, though not in the literal sense. He moved through the Firetruce crowds easily, a nondescript man who drew little attention and left few memories in his wake. He bought a spicy kebab from a vendor and enjoyed a Kailoh street play where the mummers used scented holograms for a backdrop. He loved Kailoh and its highly stylized performances. This play featured an assassin character who was killed in the end, but that part did not spoil his pleasure. The most skilled assassins were never caught, after all. If they did their job perfectly, no one would even know they existed. His organization did not exist, so far as the wilderzone was concerned. Or the Empire, for that matter.</p>
							<p>Warriors from a hundred tribes mingled in the dusty streets, drinking and sampling the wares of the great bazaar that had sprung up outside the marbled arenas, gardens, and council chambers. There were few laws here. Although the Diamond Sword did provide peacekeepers, they were unarmored and most were really spies and counterintelligence agents, anyway. The armor-equipped niwa'aban Sworder security kept mainly to the Firetruce grounds, so many bazaar merchants pooled their funds to hire mercenaries for protection. Blood Eagle and Starwolf kept their distance for the most part, but already several bloody brawls had erupted between them, resulting in a handful of deaths. None of this concerned the assassin. The drama between <a href="4_2_10_paragas.html">Ursula DiVaragas</a> and the Sirdar Fury was playing out hundreds of light years away. Here the various factions were only threats if he allowed them to notice him. He smiled at a peacekeeper and ducked into an alley to look at some firesilks.</p>
							<p>He had almost a half hour until his meeting, so there was time to kill. He was very good at killing both time and people. Time was easier, of course. He continued to move, drifting by taverns and in and out of various booths and small shops, some of which were simply tents staked out next to cargo shuttles. The speed with which the bazaar had come into being amazed him. Most of the buildings were prefab metaplas huts or thermally-shielded tents, but there were hundreds of them spreading to the west and south of the Firetruce complex, forming a shifting labyrinth of commerce. Anything could be found here, it was said, from dreamleaf to exotic beasts to the darker pleasures. All the things of life… and death.</p>
							<p>Death was his trade. Unlike the majority of people here, his services were not for sale, though in the unlikely event the conversation arose, he would have admitted he could be found here. With so many tribal leaders and dignitaries present in combination with the intrigue that shaped so much of the history of the Firetruces, it would have been unthinkable for an assassin of his caliber not to be at hand for his superiors to use if they chose.</p>
							<p>The timing of the summons struck him as a strong indication that he would be used soon. The Firetruce had not yet started, and he knew the <a href="4_2_08_renn.html">Phoenix Prime's arrival</a> had been delayed. His associates whispered that Renn Gistos yl-Harabec would likely be targeted for termination, but no one had yet received orders to bring that death about. The assassin felt a tremor of excitement. Such a prominent sanction would be a great honor for him, and would place his name high on the shadow shrines that his people secretly venerated. There was no thought of failure. He never failed.</p>
							<p>It was nearly time. He had taken a lengthy and circuitous route toward his meeting place, checking constantly to make certain no one followed. Confident he was still invisible, he slipped at last into a seedy-looking shop that sold used electronics and surplus machinery. A cheap-looking metaplas tarp covered the entrance. Pushing it aside, he stepped into a low-ceilinged room filled to shoulder height with a legion of winking, buzzing devices that filled the air with a discordant clamor. The result was a persistent white noise that would deflect most efforts to overhear a conversation, whether with technological spy gear or simple lurking. A rank chemical tang assaulted his nose, doubtless intended to defeat any sniffers brought into the place.</p>
							<p>He followed a trace of tape on the floor until he found a stool tucked in a small cul-de-sac amid the junk. There he seated himself and waited. No one came, but that was not unusual under these circumstances. Whoever summoned him would also check to see if he was followed. His surroundings appeared unremarkable save in their sloppiness. Loose circuits and optical wiring spilled out of cracked housings. A hunk of metal resembling a turbograv stabilizer leaned against the wall before him like the dorsal fin of a giant fish. A weathered hypercast casing to his right bore the snarling face of a tiger embossed in the faux bronze surface.</p>
							<p>Waiting was part of the game. Doubtless he was the subject of covert scans at the moment. He would wait as long as it took for his patron to decide to trust him. Focusing on the seven sacred mantras, he breathed deeply and evenly, letting his awareness simultaneously expand and contract so that time flowed gently around him.</p>
							<p>Finally a voice emanated from a hidden speaker, the sound baffled and modulated so the assassin could not identify neither gender nor distinguishing accent. "Put on the earlink you find behind the tiger."</p>
							<p>The assassin did so, recognizing the device from previous assignments. It was a small, microcircuit-impregnated bead one placed in the ear. Once activated, it permitted both encrypted reception and subvocal transmission for the wearer.</p>
							<p>"You are the Ghost assigned to this planet." A statement, not a question.</p>
							<p>"Yes."</p>
							<p>"You are sworn to obey <a href="4_2_09_triad.html">they whose names must not be spoken.</a>"</p>
							<p>"Yes."</p>
							<p>"How many kills?"</p>
							<p>The assassin sighed inwardly. Either he was good enough or he was not. The fact that he was here should speak of his competence. Still, he was sworn to obey. "Sixteen immaculate kills, chieftain-level or higher. Forty one lessers. Targets included officers from each of the Four, two Unitech directors, the CEO of Novalines, and six Imperial deep-cover spies."</p>
							<p>"None were traced?"</p>
							<p>He smiled at that. "I do not exist. Neither, therefore, do my deeds."</p>
							<p>There was a pause, then: "You are arrogant."</p>
							<p>"I am the Ghost of the Seventh Firetruce."</p>
							<p>"You wish to know the identity of the target? Look behind the stabilizer."</p>
							<p>He shrugged. "I have guessed already. The Phoenix Prime."</p>
							<p>Laughter in his ear. Unexpected and harsh. "Arrogant, as I have said. And fallible. Perhaps there has been a mistake."</p>
							<p>"Do not mock me." He went and knelt by the metal fin, reached behind it and withdrew a small plastic object that fit neatly in the hollow of his hand. Then he returned to his seat.</p>
							<p>The voice resumed, still tinged with amusement. "You are half right. Other arrangements have been set in motion to terminate the Phoenix Prime. You will be present when the sanction occurs, and you are to ensure he dies, but only if you can do so without risking discovery. The old man is a secondary target for you. Open the recorder to see your primary assignment."</p>
							<p>The assassin flipped the plastic device open. Inside was a holopic of a pretty young woman with honey colored hair and a bright smile. She wore a dress uniform he did not recognize, but the emblem was a purple lightning bolt. He shivered, struck by the symbol and its significance to his own purpose.</p>
							<p>"A pretty little flower. Who is she?"</p>
							<p>"She is Shana Dawn Terayl, Speaker of the Seventh Firetruce. She must die on the First of Tears."</p>

								<h2>Triad</h2>
							</header>		
					
							<p>On the world of Falcon's Crossing the wind blew ceaselessly, it was said, carrying the voices of the ancestors of the Diamond Sword. The monastery perched on a cliff a kilometer below a snow-capped peak. It was a simple structure protected by secrecy and a variety of sensor-baffling devices that made orbital detection a painstaking process at best. Only the leaders of the Diamond Sword and a few servants and token guards occupied the building.</p>
							<p>The day was clear and the sky a brilliant blue. The mountains here were of a sufficiently high altitude that the atmosphere was thin and cold but still breathable. The Reflective sat meditating in a lotus position on a cushion in a large, airy room dominated by a huge window of hand-poured teraglass. He wore a thick green robe embroidered with white falcons. Thick silk wrappings covered his feet and legs. He wore archaic spectacles that contained no microelectronics or entek components whatsoever. Their sole purpose was to correct his failing vision. The thought occurred to him that what he truly needed was a way to sharpen his perception of cause-and-effect. He was not certain that the dragon of current events had not already escaped the grasp of the Triad.</p>
							<p>Stones rise up into the sky; fire burns down in the water. So went the ancient Zen saying. Perhaps the Dragon had steered the Triad's hand instead. The Reflective mused on that riddle and found it disturbing but at the same time satisfying.</p>
							<p>A bell sounded, a brazen chime that faded slowly into the walls. The Reflective waited for the others to arrive. It did not take long. The heavy doors on the far side of the room swung open in oiled silence. The Unyielding arrived first, a proud old man striding with a habitual martial posture that exaggerated his limp, wearing a red robe that bore a batik of leaping tigers, the wooden sword of his office held firmly in his right hand. He knelt on the pillow to the right of the Reflective, placing his sword across his lap.</p>
							<p>He was closely followed by the Pure, who glided silently in her plain white robe across the polished hardwood floor. The diamond cluster of her office hung heavily around her neck on a cord of black silk. She sank into a lotus position on the pillow to the left of the Reflective. A panel of sunlight fell across her such that the diamonds caught the light and shone with their own white radiance. Her dark face resembled old wood with its deep creases and lines.</p>
							<p>A fourth pillow remained empty. Together, the pillows formed the corners of a square in the middle of the room.</p>
							<p>For a moment, no one moved. Then, as one, they bowed once and deeply. When they straightened, the Reflective reached into his robe and produced a simple mirror, the symbol of his office. He placed it gently on the floor before him and cleared his throat.</p>
							<p>"We are in the Center," he intoned.</p>
							<p>"We watch," said the Unyielding.</p>
							<p>The Pure smiled. "Thought and action are one."</p>
							<p>"I did not provide tea," the Reflective said. "Please accept my apologies."</p>
							<p>They nodded graciously, and he thanked them for their forgiveness. He breathed deeply four times before stating his concern. "The Center will be difficult to hold. We risk much with our actions."</p>
							<p>"All truth is risk," the Pure said with a frown.</p>
							<p>The Unyielding clenched his sword tightly. "We cannot retreat from our decisions."</p>
							<p>The Reflective tapped his mirror with a fingernail. "The beast enters the house while the brothers wrestle on the floor. Are we to do nothing?"</p>
							<p>"We ride our horse along the edge of a sword already," the Unyielding grated. "If the Tribes of Man knew how we have steered them over the years-"</p>
							<p>"They do not know," cut in the Pure with a ringing voice. She cast her gaze downward for a moment, then brought it up again. Her eyes were as hard as the jewels she carried. "We must have martyrs! The tribes will not unify otherwise. That is the truth."</p>
							<p>The Reflective let the doubt seep into his words. "I have a daughter just her age. As I meditate, I find uncertainty."</p>
							<p>"We have all had children. I have eight grandchildren and five great-grandchildren," the Pure answered. She shook her head. "No, we were bound to <a href="4_2_05_ghost.html">summon the Ghosts</a>."</p>
							<p>The Unyielding grunted assent. "The Phoenix Prime must not survive, and for reasons we have already discussed, our tribe cannot appear blameless. And more importantly, this young Speaker must die so that others might live. We all make sacrifices, my friend."</p>
							<p>The Reflective said nothing. He thought of the prophecy that had been circulating the wilderzone of late, passed by minstrels and vagabonds and various independent tribals. Among other things it predicted the sword shall be drawn too late, and a thousand worlds shall be rent with fire…. He wondered again if the Triad had misplaced its grip on the dragon's tail.</p>
							<p>"And what of our own tribe?" he asked flatly. "The Diamond Sword will not be spared <a href="4_2_03_demon.html">when the Hordes come</a>."</p>
							<p>The Pure offered him a sweet smile. "They have the Court of Blades to guide them while we watch."</p>
							<p>The Unyielding snorted. "I do not trust the Court. Much water, little rain."</p>
							<p>"They know how to fight. When the tribes are unified, then the Sword will doubtless be drawn," the Pure added. "The Blood Eagle and the Starwolf are both mobilized to counter the invasion of the BioDerms. They will need leadership."</p>
							<p>The Reflective nodded reluctantly. They had spent much time manipulating events in the wilderzone, and though not all had gone to their liking, much had occurred according to their will. The <a href="4_2_02_brianna.html">Starwolf and the Blood Eagle</a> were ready to bear the brunt of an invasion. The Children of Phoenix would soon gain a strong and warlike leader. The independents prepared to form their own union at the Firetruce.</p>
							<p>Still, dragons were unpredictable beasts. One could not anticipate everything. He resolved at that moment to take certain actions on his own, but such a break required extreme subtlety... and carried extreme risk. The empty pillow across from him assumed an aura of menace, as if the Ghost Facet perceived the direction of his thoughts.</p>
							<p>"Very well. I shall wait and watch with you," he lied, adjusting his spectacles very carefully indeed.</p>

								<h2>Naj-Zero</h2>
							</header>				
					
							<p>It was a fine morning the day I saw the Starwolf girl for the first time. On Ymir, that meant the sky wasn't pissing sleet all over us for a change, and the temperature was warm enough for me to unclip my hunchin' ice mask without risking frostbite.</p>
							<p>I hated the ice. Raw God, I hated it! Yet here I was, hacking blocks of the stuff out of a starkissin' glacier so Starwolf grunts could swig fresh water while they invaded my tribe's holdings. Being a prisoner-of-war stuck in my craw worse than the ice chips clinging to my face, but there I was, no mistake. So I made a game out of how fast I could whack out a block. Sure, I hated the ice, but I hated it more tolerably with my ice ax. After working up a good sweat I'd feel almost cheerful.</p>
							<p>The huge downside to any war with the Starwolf was the miserable planets you had to fight 'em on, most often some polar outhouse where your ass froze solid every time you popped your armor and you couldn't blow your nose without snot freezing all over your face. But bad as it was to fight Starwolf on their turf, it was worse to be their prisoner. The yappers didn't know warm from a blaster shot to the head. I missed the warm things in life: summer beaches, a crackling fire, the kisses of a pretty girl. All the things I couldn't have here on Ymir. Ymir was a yapper paradise, I guess. Everything was just cold.</p>
							<p>The Starwolf definitely made POWs earn their keep. We had to fill a quota before they'd pack us in for the evening. Most days we cut ice for about fourteen hours. My orange-striped coldsuit was only warm enough if I worked like a dog, so that's what I did. I wasn't alone. There were a couple dozen brother and sister knights with me, survivors of Shek Two and other places the <a href="4_2_10_paragas.html">Queen Bitch DiVaragas</a> had pounded to crap. It was either bust tail or freeze.</p>
							<p>They had to feed us plenty to keep us going. At least they didn't starve us. Concentrated Ration Packs-we called 'em CRAP-kept our energy up, but the rubbery glop didn't keep the belly happy. Most nights I barely had enough energy to choke my CRAP down and stumble off to the foam slab that was my bed. Between the work and the exhaustion, I could almost forget how much I missed my freedom. Almost.</p>
							<p>So that morning we'd been at it an hour or so when a <a href="4_2_02_brianna.html">couple of T-gravs cruised by</a> carrying Starwolf warriors, mostly young fems wearing that sexy bare-belly armor I wish the Blood Eagle would adopt. They tossed us the usual round of curses and taunts as they passed, so I jumped up on top of the nearest ice block, bowed, and flashed 'em my best grin. That bought me more insults from them, nothing too creative. Just a buncha newbloods yappin' off. My grin got bigger as they shot by less than thirty meters off. Yap-yap-yap!</p>
							<p>But there was one wolfgirl who didn't yell anything. She even smiled back at me-an honest smile! It was the warmest thing I'd seen on Ymir so far. She was cute, too, from what I saw as they sped by. And there was something else in her face, something sad that stuck with me so I remembered it later. She was different somehow. The grin stayed on my face as I watched her go.</p>
							<p>"Hey! Back to work, scrof!" One of the guards landed next to me with a faint hum of armor jets and a metallic thump. He jabbed his chaingun at me. "Keep your eyes off our fems, hear?"</p>
							<p>I hopped down and held my hands out in mock puzzlement. "Ayia! Can I help it if you Starwolf are so damn attractive?"</p>
							<p>He just stared for a second, clenched a fist like he was thinking about using it, but then he just waved me away. I went back to work, and the memory of the Starwolf girl kept me going strong through the rest of the morning. I wondered if I'd ever see her again. I hoped so. That was a damn nice smile she had, and I wouldn't mind seconds.</p>
							<p>Time flew, and before long the guards called the midday break. I grabbed my rations and found a place to sit. I hadn't been there long when the Shank Pig lumbered up and unclipped his ice mask. A Sergeant who'd served in the Skullgrinder Chapter back on Shek Two, the Pig was a mountain of ugly muscle: heavy-set features, beady eyes, and a big black Blood Eagle tattoo right on his forehead. The tattoo's wingtips curved around his temples to just under each eye, kind of like a mask. He was a mean scrof, and he and his dirtbagger buddies had their own little deal going in our work crew. Nobody called him "Shank Pig" to his face, of course. His warnom was "Racksaw."</p>
							<p>Right now he looked down at me and sneered. "Gemme yer food bar, Naj. It's yer day to contribute."</p>
							<p>Normally we just gave the Shank Pig whatever he wanted and stepped aside. They generally followed a routine, so nobody went hungry longer than a day. It wasn't worth the hurt he and his boys would dish out. So I shrugged and tossed him the piece I hadn't eaten.</p>
							<p>"Thanks, pansy." He ripped it open and took a huge bite. "What you think o'them yapper biffs we saw this mornin', heya? Bet they wiggle nice in the dark." Little chunks of food dribbled out of his mouth as he laughed at his own joke. I thought about this pusgut pawing my wolfgirl and something colder than the glacier woke in me. I jumped up and slapped the rest of the rat bar from his paw.</p>
							<p>For a second, he froze. Nobody had stood up to the Pig before. Raw God, I could hardly believe I was doing it, but I swear it was like ice burning through me. I was shaking with rage. Maybe it was the ice, the shame, or just that the girl was the one bright spot I'd had since I came to this iceball. Whichever it was, I was done with bending knee to motherless filth like the Shank Pig.</p>
							<p>A grin split his face like a slit in a meatball. "Heya, pansy, looks like yer grew a spine somewhere."</p>
							<p>"I'm Naj-Zero, Knight of the Shining Fist Talon, no starkissin' pansy," I snarled. "You're a worthless, lard-gutted, scrof-eatin' no-namer who wouldn't know honor from a hole in his a-"</p>
							<p>The grin vanished and he swung at me. Now I wasn't reckoned short, but I looked like a kid next to this monster. So when I blocked his punch, it still knocked me tail over pinfeathers. I fetched up against an ice block feeling like my arm had been hit by a hammer.</p>
							<p>The Pig was still coming at me, his face red. "Gonna feed you those words along with your teeth, scrof!"</p>
							<p>Fight smart, my trainers always taught me. Use the terrain to your advantage. There wasn't a lot to use here unless I wanted to run, and I was in no mood for that. Our Starwolf guards weren't in a hurry to break this little show up, it looked like, so I was on my own. As I rolled up to a crouch, the ground crunched underneath me and I got an idea. I grabbed up a couple good handfuls of ice and squeezed up a nice, hard ball. The Pig reached for me, but I dodged out of the way and slammed my package right into his fat face, so hard I felt the jolt right up to my shoulder. The Pig stumbled, and I kicked him in the spleen. Then I followed up with a quick series of combinations to his face and solar plex. I couldn't hit too well with my hurt arm, but my other shots did count. All these days of hacking ice had put on a lot more extra muscle than I realized. The iceball had half-blinded him, too, so it wasn't too tough to slip his gorilla swipes. I finished it with a sweep that put him down on his fat ass. I felt great… until I saw his dirtbagger friends watching me. Their expressions told me this wasn't over.</p>
							<p>The Pig rolled to his side, retching. I waited on the balls of my feet, ready to keep it going. His friends didn't do anything, to my relief. One of the Starwolf guards yelled at us to get back to work. Break was over.</p>
							<p>"Yer gonna pay, Naj," was all the Pig said when he could talk again. "Pay hard." He limped off and left me to pick up my ice ax and go back to work. My arm still ached where I'd made the bad block.</p>
							<p>Raw God, I thought. What in Seven Hells have you done, Naj? A yapper fem smiles at you, and you go <a href="4_2_08_renn.html">waking the Phoenix</a>! But then I shook those doubts out of my brain. The wolfgirl was definitely worth it.</p>
							<p>I wondered if I'd ever see her again.</p>
