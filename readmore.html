							<br>Tribes 2 isn't easy to master, and it won't play well on every gaming PC, but when you're up and running it's a tremendous amount of fun.

							<p>When Starsiege: Tribes came out at the very end of 1998, it was the first of its kind: a retail first-person shooter designed specifically for multiplayer competition. The intervening years have seen other popular action games focused primarily on multiplayer competition, but none have had the same emphasis on teamplay in large, wide-open areas, with plenty of players participating in each match. Not until Tribes 2. Experienced Tribes players will find that the sequel makes relatively few changes to the successful core mechanics of the original but that it features substantially improved graphics, even larger network games, and more items, vehicles, and equipment to use in battle. For those new to the series, Tribes 2 also offers extensive offline training options. Unfortunately, a number of technical problems in the initial retail release have dampened some players' enthusiasm for what is otherwise an outstanding multiplayer action game.</p>
							
							<p>Tribes 2 inherits its sci-fi setting from Dynamix's series of mech games, including Earthsiege and Starsiege. Much of what distinguishes Tribes 2's style from that of other first-person shooters stems from this background, including the distinctively large outdoor settings in the game, and also the focus on high-tech equipment such as jump jets and mobile armor suits. Most of the contextual story built up in the earlier games has since fallen away, along with the "Starsiege" surname, since most players came to refer to the original simply as "Tribes" anyway. But the context of Tribes 2 still lends some coherence to the in-game taunts and the mix of harsh environments that will become your playground. You have the choice of three classes of mobile armor suits to wear in battle--the light scout, medium assault, and heavy juggernaut--and they differ in mobility and arsenal. All the classes have a lot of equipment choices and can carry three to five weapons, plus grenades, mines, and a special equipment pack all at once. The inventory system has been significantly streamlined in the new game, so you can set up equipment presets that go into effect when you use a base inventory station anytime during a match.</p>
							
							<p>Tribes 2's different style extends to its pacing, which is somewhat slower and more deliberate than what you'd find in some other popular shooters such as Unreal Tournament and Counter-Strike. The first thing you'll notice in comparison is the effect that the jetpack has on combat. The jetpack gives you limited upward or directional thrust, and though it takes a while to learn how to combine this with ordinary ground movement, the combination is potent, so players in light and medium suits move very quickly over rough terrain. Players jetting through the air are quite difficult to hit with the game's slow projectile weapons, so combat between aerial players often focuses on trying to lead an opponent's landing to deliver explosive splash damage. The game's direct attack weapons make it possible to fell a flying opponent, and the new heat-seeking missile launcher adds an additional threat that's hard to shake once it locks on. The net effect of the game's mobile armors suits and jetpacks is to make combat less decisive and less deadly in wide-open outdoor terrain, while the explosive heavy weapons and turret defenses tend to keep indoor brawls vicious and short. But there's room for you to play various niche roles, such as when you're equipped with the cloaking pack and the game's new melee weapon, the shocklance--a combination that can be used to sneak up on enemies inside their own base for a fatal backstab.</p>
							
							<p>The game offers a lot more than just deathmatch and capture-the-flag game modes. The free-for-all variations derived from popular Starsiege: Tribes mods are good for games with fewer players and make the most of Tribes 2's map style. Rabbit is a single-flag game where the player who carries the flag is "it." There's often a terrific scrimmage as other players try to grab the flag and make a run back to their bases. Hunters is reminiscent of the headhunter mods for other multiplayer games. As players die, they drop flags that can be collected for points at a central location. The real scramble happens when someone who's gathered a lot of flags is fragged, an event that's greeted with a jubilant "Yard sale!" voice-over as opponents gather to fight over the remains.</p>
							
							<p>However, it's with the large team games that Tribes 2 is really impressive. The scale of these games is unmatched; there will often be 40 to 60 (or even more) players on a single server. The game's network code is quite good and supports these numbers well on servers with sufficient dedicated bandwidth, but some warping does occur in games containing many more than 60 players. The larger maps easily accommodate this many players and generally feature vehicle pads so that a portion of each team spends its time in the game's six vehicles.</p>
							
							<p>There are many roles you can fill during a game of Tribes 2: these include sniping, setting up defenses, and going on runs in the three-man bomber to destroy enemy structures and turrets. It's easy enough to switch roles to do whatever needs to be done to help the team, so casual matches without explicit team planning can still be quite enjoyable. The game's command map makes the chaos of the battlefield a little easier to understand. It shows the status of teammates, base facilities, and the team sensor network that ties into each player's HUD. While the command interface is cumbersome, it does give you a fairly effective system for suggesting what team tasks need to be accomplished.</p>
							
							<p>While having vehicles in smaller games, those with fewer than 20 people, can dilute the action, overall they add an extra dimension to the combat in Tribes 2. There are three ground vehicles and three air vehicles, divided among scout, assault, and support craft. Half of these (the larger ones) let two or more players jump on board, which can require some coordination around a map's vehicle pad. However, the tank and bomber craft require such particular cooperation between the pilot and gunner that it can be very frustrating to pair up with someone who's less experienced. Additionally, the larger vehicles are sluggish and can be fairly difficult to control, and you may even find that the nose of the larger ground vehicles will occasionally pitch up or down unrealistically on rough but relatively level terrain, seemingly due to problems with the game's physics. It's also frustrating that a mere brush with a tree at low speeds can inflict inordinate damage to the most imposing hovertank.</p>
							
							<p>To make it easier to talk to other players in between games and organize teams, Tribes 2 has a number of online community features built right into the game. The active Starsiege: Tribes community is a strong point in favor of Tribes 2, and right from the start there have been hundreds of game servers to choose from. In fact, high loads on the central authentication and community servers since the release of Tribes 2 have made it impossible for Dynamix to run all the community services, but the game finder, news, and chat functions are up and working. The other features, like pages for team and player information as well as integrated e-mail and Web browsing, were working in the beta tests but have been temporarily disabled until the servers can be upgraded.</p>
							
							<p>Tribes 2 is primarily an online game, but it does include more solo options than its predecessor. It includes five tutorials to ease the learning curve and introduce new players to the game's unique movement, numerous items, and command options. Many of the maps can also be played against computer-controlled bot opponents, which can help you get used to the game before jumping online. The bots aren't really capable enough to make offline games very interesting, and though they do manage to carry out team functions, like setting up basic defenses and executing flag runs, they aren't particularly good at it. They also seem to stand in place more often than you'd expect.</p>
							
							<p>The most obvious difference between Tribes and Tribes 2 is the new graphics engine in the sequel, which was completely reworked to take advantage of hardware acceleration and more powerful PCs. If you do have a high-end system, the game looks good. On the maps that aren't fogged in by design, the visible horizon is distant and sharp. The explosions are suitably impressive, and there are some nice effects like footsteps on snow maps and variable precipitation. A fractal system also produces smoothly varying terrain textures that have a surprising amount of detail up close. However, as a result of these effects and the game's large environments, many mainstream systems play the game sluggishly unless many of the effects are turned off and textures are turned down. At these lower levels of detail, the game doesn't look particularly good at all, even compared to the original Tribes. To play the game well, we'd recommend a system with at least a 600MHz Pentium III and a GeForce or Radeon graphics card. As ambitious shooters tend to, the Tribes 2 engine has room to grow as faster systems become more common. For example, one of the systems we tried the game on, a Pentium 4 1.5GHz with GeForce2 Ultra, had no trouble maintaining a very smooth frame rate at 1024x768 with maximum detail turned on.</p>
							
							<p>A lot of effort obviously went into rounding out the game, but it still has some rough edges. The game's sound is quite polished, including many prerecorded voice taunts that you can use in-game by selecting them from a series of quick chat menus. Tribes 2 includes a custom soundtrack--an unsurprising mix of electronica and guitar that you'll probably turn down before long. But the game's biggest shortcoming is that it released with several significant technical problems, which Dynamix is progressively addressing in frequent patches. The game runs without problems on many systems, but some players have had difficulty getting it to work at all.</p>
							
							<p>Tribes 2 is an ambitious follow-up to the game that single-handedly led the charge of multiplayer-only action games into retail. The deep teamplay that you can find in large matches is incredibly addicting and offers some interesting opportunities to cobble together team strategies. The game takes advantage of skills developed in twitch shooters like Quake, but its slower pacing requires a more deliberate and diverse range of tactics. In the end, this will help give Tribes 2 tremendous longevity, especially considering that the original Tribes still rivals both Unreal Tournament and Quake III Arena as one of the most played multiplayer action games. Tribes 2 isn't easy to master, and it won't play well on every gaming PC, but when you're up and running it's a tremendous amount of fun.</p>

							<p>I move without fear among the tribal kin of the Slavers, wearing the weak shape I have endured since emerging from the changing vats. My copy of the tribal human we captured is very good; so far no one has questioned the gaps in my knowledge as a result of "head injury," and I observe and gather information without interference. Comrades think me slow-witted, so their tongues wag freely in my presence. My pheromone implants let me draw information from a variety of unwitting sources; a lover in the starport here provided me datalinks to the troop manifests. I disposed of her afterwards. The frozen oceans here contain an admirable predator called a 'razor hag.' We shall have to capture some gene samples after we eradicate the humans and claim the planet.</p>
							
							<p>Preliminary assessments indicate- wait…</p>
							
							<p>I must be brief. The damned Skaduvarg - that is what the Starwolf Security calls itself - must have traced the quantum ripple of my transmitter. I was able to relocate without losing my connection, but the Skaduvarg are likely only temporarily delayed. I will have to abandon the transmitter… if I escape alive.</p>
							
							<p>The Great Traitor is correct. Great numbers of Starwolf muster here in cramped orbital stations or temporary surface camps. Many are inexperienced warriors, snot-nosed vatscum called 'newbloods' who think to learn war and survive the lesson. I befriended one the other day, and she's provided me with good cover, the little fool.</p>
							
							<p>As you already know, the Starwolf prepare to assault the neighboring Charybdis system. A woman called Fury leads the Blood Eagle there. Thanks to the Great Traitor, she lacks the strength to offer battle, so we can devour her at our leisure after we take Ymir. I wish I could see Fury in chains. From what I hear, she would make good sport.</p>
							
							<p>The other major tribes are not a threat. Simpering Children of Phoenix whine about peace at their Firetruce, but nobody cares. Other vatsatz brethren are in place to keep them and the Diamond Sword at each other's throats. Diamond Sword deployments indicate the Sworders smell something of the truth regarding the Empire, but they have said nothing to the Starwolf.</p>
							
							<p>Curse it, the hunters are getting close. They must know I'm here. Not much time left….</p>
							
							<p>The jumpgate is secure against Blood Eagle incursion, but not against us. Defensive platforms maintain a tight ring around the system entry points, but once our reavers pass this ring, Ymir and the Starwolf are-
							Urh, that hurts. A human stumbled onto my hiding place. Bad luck for him, but he singed me before I twisted his head off. No sign of the other hunters yet. Where was I?</p>
							
							<p>The Starwolf here are nothing but fresh meat. At least half the tribal dropships undergo repairs and status checks with only skeleton crews aboard. The attached Starwolf IFF code strings should delay any defensive response until it is too late.</p>
							
							<p>They're coming. Damn the Skadus! Control, this is my last transmission. I must destroy this sender. If I escape, I will flee Ymir and continue gathering intelligence elsewhere. If I do not survive, I shall return to serve the Bloodsoul in another form. Let my crèche kin know I died a hero of the Hordes.</p>

							<font color="05d200"><font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font></font> … probably listening, damn them. Can you ascertain?<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font> Maybe. (pause) No. I can't find anything. If Cardinal Spear is listening, they've concealed their snoopers well. But remember, my hardware's detection peripherals aren't state-of-the-art.<br>
							<font color="05d200"><font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font></font> Of course. Always excuses, woman. I am yet again reminded of how you failed me.<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font> I didn't fail you, by the Wolf! Face the truth.<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> I see truth constantly, my dear Freya. And the truth of your betrayal burns like fire. Ah, God, after all these years it still pains me to remember how you turned your back on me! Do you feel triumph at the wound you opened on that day?<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font> How could I turn my back on you? I don't even have a body; what you see is a projected hologram simulation. And you know I can't feel triumph.<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> (laugh) I very much doubt that, witch.<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font> You set my design specs. You know my capabilities better than anyone else.<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> Who made whom, I wonder. Yes, I wonder. Now, this matter with DeBures. Do you truly believe he has joined Fury?<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font> From what my datafiles tell me of Pennant-Commander Ram DeBures, he would sooner die than betray his vows to you. I have to conclude he's either a hostage or a dead man.<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> No, no, he's betrayed me, as have so many others. God curse that faithless bastard! Where's his family? Why are the heads of his children not on my table?<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font> You didn't give the order.<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> Well, I give the order now.<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> It will be difficult. The DeBures bloodline moved the Pennant-Commander's family offworld out of respect for your disappointment at his failure. If you retaliate against his family without good cause, you will alienate the entire bloodline.<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> My God, traitors surround me! What of the other bloodlines-aside from those bastard-born Starkweathers? How do they see the defection of Sier DeBures?<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font> The Halakar are as hard to read as ever, but my guess is they secretly back Fury. She has to have some source for all the weapons and supplies she's using to fortify Charybdis. The Nagashima, Sabot-Styx, and DeBures support you fully, as do the Konovalev, of course. I don't know about the Eun Alba. They've been pretty vocal lately about the danger posed by the Starwolf.<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> Damn them all. Do we have proof that the Halakar bow to Fury?<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font> Of course not.<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> Have I had any of them killed yet?<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font> No.<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> Then let us have one of their junior scions taken and made into an example. Hands and feet only. Sent to Lord Tarun in a nice jeweled box. Yes, that should convey the proper warning.<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font> Alexandre, my programming on human political psychology recommends against this.<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> You have never understood our ways, milady. (pause) Yet I once thought the Starwolf capable of loyalty. Why did you leave me? Why abandon your son? Poor Ulysses was despondent, you know.<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font> (sigh) Freya Cloudchaser, not me - I am a computer-generated hologram, remember? -- terminated the marriage after Geoffrey died. You treated his suicide as an act of cowardice.<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> He was weak! He could never have been my son, damn him! A Konovalev never breaks! Who did you sleep with to produce that milksop, eh? And there was Ulysses still. Ulysses. Ah yes, by God, he was a true son of mine.<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font> (inaudible)<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> What was that you said?<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font> A defective speech subroutine. Forget it.<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> Explain to me what you said. I command you.<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font> I said, "That probability is low" in response to your previous comment about Ulysses being your true son.<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> Christ and Hunter! You dare…!<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font> (screams)<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font> That wasn't necessary.<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> I must punish such insolence harshly. Even from you, my wife.<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font> I am not your wi-(screams)<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> You will always be my wife, Freya. No matter how far you run. No matter how often you deny me, I will always be here to chastise you.<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font> I am an advanced holofeed AI simulacrum, Alexan-(screams)<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> You will address me as "Great and Noble Lord." On your knees.<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font> As you wish, Great and Noble Lord. But I am not your wife. Your son Ulysses is gone. Please try to accept your gri-(screams)<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> Tell me, do you truly feel pain when I press this button, Freya?<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font> Not as you'd understand it, Great and Noble Lord. I feel what you might call "extreme dissonance."<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> I can destroy you with but a simple word. Does that not cause you to fear me?<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font> We've had this conversation many times before, Great and Noble Lord. I'm aware you can verbally trigger a termination subroutine in my programming.<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> And you do fear me, do you not?<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font> I can simulate any emotional state you require.</p>
							<p style="text-align: center;">(4.2 second pause)</p>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> Tell me again about Ursula DiVaragas. Is she truly formidable enough to destroy Fury?<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font> She has the numbers, certainly. Plenty of experience. More than enough hatred.<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> Ah, yes, I understand hatred quite well. I almost feel a kinship with this mongrel. Continue.<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font> I don't have a clear projection as to who would win if they were more evenly matched. However, a Starwolf force substantial enough to roll through Fury at Charybdis would be a real threat in Blood Eagle territory. The Bloodlines are nervous that-<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> The Starwolf are not a threat. I have already seen to their neutralization. (inaudible) …destroy Fury and then perish. (laugh) Good dogs, all.<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font> I don't see how you plan to accomplish that, Great and Noble Lord. The Starwolf are a major problem for you. The Blood Eagle are divided, the Diamond Sword remain neutral, and the Children of Phoenix haven't shown any signs of intervening.<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> Renn Gistos is useless, his Firetruce a sandtrap for cowards. Foolish of him to yield to the Triad's machinations. No other Phoenix Prime would have tolerated even the possibility of such a concession. But rest assured, wife, the Starwolf will discover there are worse things in the heavens than they know of. I know many secrets. DiVaragas will fall after she crushes Fury.</p>
							<p style="text-align: center;">(1.6 second pause)</p>
							But why are you on your knees? Arise and walk with me!<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font> Whatever you say, Great and Noble Lord.<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> So formal, my dear! Call me Alexi, as you did when we were first married.<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font> Whatever you say, Alexi.<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> They underestimate me. They believe me weak, poisoned from betrayal and loss. I will show them otherwise. I will, you know. Now, tell me.<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font> Tell you what?<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> The name of your lover, of course. I'm not stupid.<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font> Alexi, I am not Freya Cloudchaser. I'm a Class Five Galatea Artificial Intelligence Anima running parasapient algorithms on a Theta-level biochip array. My personality is modeled from a detailed psychological profile of your former wife. I don't have the information you want. I would give it to you if I could, but the data is too sparse to be more than rank speculation. I can't project a conclusion with any significant degree of accuracy. Please listen to me.</p>
							<p style="text-align: center;">(18.4 second pause)</p>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> Again. You refuse me again. Despite the pain I have endured on your behalf….<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font> Alexi, don't-<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> Witch! I sacrificed my son for you! You leave me no choice!<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font> Please, I-(scream)<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> Do you realize how much pain this causes me?<br>

							<div ul style="text-align:left;">
							<p>Honored Shisou:<br>
							Greetings in the name of the Reflective. I trust you are enjoying your meditations and that your wa remains undisturbed.</p></div>
							<div ul style="text-align:left; list-style-type:square;">
							<li><p>I have little to report on the Phoenix front today. Haitou Asaken has still not circumvented the Prime's countersurveillance, but the elevated degree of secrecy surrounding the Prime suggests something is wrong. We are attempting to attain more concrete data. The only remarkable note I have for you thus far is that the Prime has expressed an unusual interest in the Tsayadin Speaker Shana Dawn Terayl. The only link we have discovered thus far is that Terayl once belonged to the Phoenix tribe before turning independent. This is not new information, but we continue to probe. As you recall, the <li>Pure Facet was most insistent on appointing Terayl to the post.</li><br>
							<li>We identified two Harbinger agents in the Phoenix technical support and communications detachment. Per your previous instructions, they have been placed under discreet surveillance. So far they do nothing more than observe and report back to Malderi at Ashkelon III.</li><br>
							<li>The fraytown and bazaar continue to roil in sporadic outbreaks of lawlessness. Nothing remarkable to report here. A brawl in the Shaganti zone south of the river involved a young off-duty Niwa'aban surodoi and a known interstellar raconteur. Two bystanders were killed, and the raconteur escaped.</li></p>
							
							<div class="clear" style="text-align: center;padding: 7px 0px 5px 0px;">
							<font color="red"><p>INCIDENT REPORT SUBFILE ACCESS&gt;</font></p>
							
							<p>Our surodoi was unharmed. She returns to duty tomorrow. I believe we will profit from her presence on the hunter detail.
							<li>The tension between the Blood Eagle and the Starwolf has stabilized. We placed armored surodoi as an interdiction between the main encampments, and that has proven a sufficient restraint. Blood Eagle Knights from the Order of the Talon proved to be helpful in keeping the peace. This Order currently maintain nominal fealty to the Great Eagle, but my sources say they are taking a neutral position in the civil war that threatens the Blood Eagle.
							Reflective Facet leaders here received an unusual haiku in this week's sending from Falcon's Crossroad:</li></p>
							
							<em><p>In the midst of flames<br>
							Hides a flower of diamond<br>
							Ah, the early frost!</p></em></div>
							
							<p>I regret I do not have an answer for this yet, Honored Shisou. We are meditating on it. Laracon believes it is a warning, and that is what my intuition tells me as well. Cryptic instructions regarding Trigon strategies accompanied the haiku, and I have ordered those instructions carried out. Curiously, we have received queries from the Pure Facet regarding any and all communications from the Triad. Perhaps your Juma connections will be able to enlighten us as to this sudden interest from the priesthood.</p>
							
							<div ul style="text-align:left; list-style-type:square;">
							<p><li>You asked me to report any particularly mysterious events that occurred here. I have only one. A minor incident, but remarkable. It seems that on the fringes of the Bazaar, someone murdered three Grievers and disappeared. Literally disappeared, Honored One. The reports we took describe how this man walked out past a half-dozen armed Grievers and simply vanished after entering the crowd. There was no indication of a cloaking field, and the Grievers pursued with motion detectors. Several witnesses confirmed the reports. It is as if they saw a ghost.</li>
							<li>Further, the dead Grievers had no marks on them aside from slight bruising where they each received their deathblow. Autopsies concluded that in each case, death resulted from a single blow to the neck or the temple, and very likely occurred instantly. Expressions on the faces of the victims suggest they had no time to react. Remarkable if only one perpetrator was responsible. It suggests a killer of extreme competence, possibly artificially enhanced. Motive is still unproven, but we believe the Grievers had something this "ghost" wanted to obtain. The Grievers became truculent in response to questions about their merchandise, and a niwa'aban search discovered a surprising amount of contraband, including Imperial black market goods.</li><p></div>
							
							<p>That is all, Honored Shisou. We look forward to your return next month.</p>
							<p>May the Enlightened Master bring you clarity.<br></p>

							<p><font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> Uhhh… Where am I?<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font>  Bring the lights back up slowly, Esgil.<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> Who are you guys?<br>
							<font color="079866">&lt;Voice 3&gt;:</font>  I'm popping the restraints.<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font>  Wait a minute-<br>
							<font color="079866">&lt;Voice 3&gt;:</font>  He checks out. No indication of biotech implants or abnormal physiology. He's no vatsatz.<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> Vat what?<br>
							<font color="079866">&lt;Voice 3&gt;:</font>  Vatsatz. Either a BioDerm or an Imperial bioengineered spy. We're not sure which.<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font>  My money's on the Hordes.<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> Who are you guys?<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font>  Friends. Trust us.<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> Right. You just said you didn't want to let me out of that chair. Why should I trust you?<br>
							<font color="079866">&lt;Voice 3&gt;:</font>  Because we're Starwolf too.<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> I never heard of you. Where are you from? What system? What pack?<br>
							<font color="079866">&lt;Voice 3&gt;:</font>  We can't tell you.<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font>  You wouldn't believe us anyway.<br>
							<font color="079866">&lt;Voice 3&gt;:</font>  We are Starwolf, though. Distant kin.<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font> (mutters): You can say that again.<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> I don't buy it. If you're Starwolf, why this symbol? It's not the face of the Great Wolf.<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font>  Listen, the Great Wolf has many faces, OK? This is one of them. Now let's get to your story.<br>
							<font color="079866">&lt;Voice 3&gt;:</font>  We want you to tell us about Ymir.<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> Why do you want to know about Ymir?<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font>  We're trying to find out as much as we can. Do you mind?<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> I still don't know who in Dark you are. Without something more, you aren't getting scat.<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font>  By the Starred Hunter! I can't believe you're dragging things on like this! We told you we're Starwolf! We showed you our tats when we picked you up! We knew the hand codes!<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> Sorry, but that's where you screwed up.<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font>  What?<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> Yeah, those codes are only used for ceremonial hunting purposes these days. (laugh) Dark, it's like using Latin or English instead of Neolac. You don't have a clue about basic Starwolf combat code.<br>
							<font color="079866">&lt;Voice 3&gt;:</font>  We pulled you out of that ship before it was too late.<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> Thanks, but maybe you didn't do me that much of a favor.<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font>  What, you'd rather be dead of radiation poisoning? Excuse us for misunderstanding kin ties!<br>
							<font color="079866">&lt;Voice 3&gt;:</font>  Shut up, Wrett. I'm going to tell him.<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font>  You can't, Esgil! That's crazy! Tell him and you compromise three hundred years of effort and endanger us all.<br>
							<font color="079866">&lt;Voice 3&gt;:</font>  He's kin. That's why we're here, remember? Besides, I'm the ranking officer here.<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> What in Dark are you talking about?<br>
							<font color="079866">&lt;Voice 3&gt;:</font>  It's easier for me to show you. Come on.<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font>  This is a mistake, Esgil.<br>
							<font color="079866">&lt;Voice 3&gt;:</font>  It's my call, Wrett. We need to talk to a survivor. An eyewitness.<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font>  …<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font>  Fine. Don't say I didn't warn you.<br>
							<font color="079866">&lt;Voice 3&gt;:</font>  Come on. Liamm, isn't it? This way.<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> I've never seen this ship design before.<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font>  What a klickin' surprise.<br>
							<font color="079866">&lt;Voice 3&gt;:</font>  (sigh) Hunter's bones, Wrett. Could you be any more of an ass? This is our bridge.<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> Interesting design. Looks about as Starwolf as a sandraker's temple.<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font>  Told you he wouldn't believe.<br>
							<font color="079866">&lt;Voice 3&gt;:</font>  We haven't told him yet, damn it.<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> Told me what?<br>
							<font color="079866">&lt;Voice 3&gt;:</font>  We told you we were distant kinfolk, yes?<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> And you've gotten a lot wrong for me to believe you, remember?<br>
							<font color="079866">&lt;Voice 3&gt;:</font>  This is our home system. One of them, anyway.<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> Huh. Never heard of it. B-class binary like that? Doesn't seem like there's much in the way of a life zone, even if you found terrestrial planets there.<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font>  There is no life zone there.<br>
							<font color="079866">&lt;Voice 3&gt;:</font>  Here's the population numbers.<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> (laugh) You have to be kidding!<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font>  What?<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> There isn't a planet in the wilderzone with that kind of population. Where the Dark is this place?<br>
							<font color="079866">&lt;Voice 3&gt;:</font>  Here.<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> …<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font>  Damn. If that doesn't look like one of Alice's monkey frogs, I'll eat my armor.<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> (whispers) That's impossible.<br>
							<font color="079866">&lt;Voice 3&gt;:</font>  Very possible. With the right mapping.<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> You-you're telling the truth about this?<br>
							<font color="079866">&lt;Voice 3&gt;:</font>  You bet.<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font>  You want me to get you a drink… cousin?<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> Yeah. A stiff one.<br>
							<font color="079866">&lt;Voice 3&gt;:</font>  You OK?<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> You mind if I sit down?<br>
							<font color="079866">&lt;Voice 3&gt;:</font>  Be my guest. Over here, if you don't mind.<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font>  Here's your drink. Now will you tell us about Ymir?<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> Don't you know what happened?<br>
							<font color="079866">&lt;Voice 3&gt;:</font>  Just the general details.<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> Ah, damn. It wasn't supposed to happen… the way it did.<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font>  Come on, man, pull it together! I thought you nearsiders had stones.<br>
							<font color="079866">&lt;Voice 3&gt;:</font>  Ease off, Wrett. He's been through a lot, for Hunter's sake!<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font>  Shh…! <br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> …been mustering for two months. Strikepacks with warriors from over forty systems streamed to Ymir. I'd never seen so many Wolves at once. No one had. Dark, there was even a girl who came from Narhaven out on the Fringe. Can you believe that?<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font>  Narhaven? Where the hell is that? <br>
							<font color="079866">&lt;Voice 3&gt;:</font>  Near Scipio. Now quiet.<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> We had an army that was the greatest single fighting muster the wilderzone had ever seen.<br>
							And we had Ursula DiVaragas heading it. By the Great Wolf, how could we lose? There was no way the Blood Eagle could win. No way!<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font>  They smacked you, didn't they?<br>
							<font color="079866">&lt;Voice 3&gt;:</font>  Wrett, will you shut the Dark up?<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font>  They were there, weren't they? I heard the Blood Eagle were there.<br>
							<font color="079866">&lt;Voice 3&gt;:</font>  Transmitted reports were garbled. We didn't confirm-<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> No.<br>
							<font color="079866">&lt;Voice 3&gt;:</font>  Excuse me?<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> The B-E didn't 'smack' us. We had some Blood Eagle prisoners on Ymir, but that was it.
							You want to hear this or not?<br>
							<font color="079903">&lt;Voice 2&gt;:</font>  Yeah. Sorry.<br>
							<font color="079866">&lt;Voice 3&gt;:</font>  Let's pause this recording for now. Take a break and go below. I think I want a drink in
							hand myself for this story.<br>
							<font color="05d200">&lt;Voice 1&gt;:</font> Whatever. Hey, are you really from...</div></p>

							<div ul style="text-align:left;"><font color="05d200">ZONE VOX:</font> This is Jamez Ardlusse at the Firetruce of the Tribes of Man on the beautiful world of Bella Omega. I'm sitting here with none other than Renn Gistos yl-Harabec, the Phoenix Prime and presiding luminary here</div></p>

							<p>&lt;&lt;Holy Hunter. That's not the same man he used to be. Look at the indications of weight loss.&gt;&gt;<br>
							((He's an old man.))<br>
							&lt;&lt;Yes, but four months ago he had at least twenty more kilos on him. Check the records.&gt;&gt;</div>
							<p><font color="079866">RENN GISTOS:</font> Hardly that, Jamez. There is a Speaker here, you know. I'm just an old man trying to help bring people together.</p>

							&lt;&lt;See? Those have to be fleshpads to make his face look less wasted.&gt;&gt;<br>
							<font color="079866">RG:</font> That's true. We should probably host it more frequently, but really it's a culmination of a lot of other diplomatic work over the years. Given the vastness of the wilderzone, having regular Firetruces would become quite tiring very quickly, I suspect.<br>
							<font color="05d200">ZV:</font>Can you tell us what you see ahead for the current Firetruce?</div></p>

							<div ul style="text-align:left;"><font color="079866"><p>RG:</font> I have much hope, Jamez. The Tribes of Man are weary of war.<br>

							<div ul style="text-align:center;"><font color="e8b857"><p>PAN BACK</p></font></div>
							<div ul style="text-align:left;"><p><font color="05d200">ZV:</font> Tell that to the Blood Eagle and the Starwolf, Milord. We understand Fury is mounting a campaign that will start another B-E civil war.<br>
							&lt;&lt;Christ. That's insane.&gt;&gt;<br>
							((Konovalev's the insane one. Fury may be onto something.))<br>
							&lt;&lt;Are you kidding me?&gt;&gt;<br>
							<font color="079866">RG:</font> Complete madness. I don't understand such a decision, especially with Ursula DiVaragas threatening at their doorstep. I had hoped-<br>
							&lt;&lt;Hey, look at this.&gt;&gt;<br>

							&lt;&lt;Computer, freeze frame. OK, take a look. See the tightening of his jaw here?&gt;&gt;<br>
							((Yes. Interesting.))<br>
							&lt;&lt;That's a man in pain. A lot of it.&gt;&gt;<br>
							((OK, so we know he's suffering, and we have a better idea of what's causing the weight loss.))<br>
							&lt;&lt;How in hells did they keep this under wraps?&gt;&gt;<br>
							((The wilderzone's a big place. Spies can't be everywhere.))<br>
							&lt;&lt;Yeah, yeah. Computer, resume play.&gt;&gt;<br>
							<font color="079866">RG:</font> Nothing… nothing. The… thought struck me that… the war might well result in the indiscriminate use of ecocidals.<br>
							&lt;&lt;Nice recovery, Renn, but I don't think she buys it.&gt;&gt;</div></p>

							<div ul style="text-align:left;"><p><font color="05d200">ZV:</font> Are you well, Milord?<br>
							<font color="079866">RG:</font> I am recovering from a touch of the X-pox, nothing more. (laughs) But thank you for your concern. It's quite touching.<br>
							<font color="05d200">ZV:</font> Can you tell us why you've allowed the Diamond Sword to host this Firetruce? I understand it was quite a controversial decision in your own ranks.<br>
							&lt;&lt;That's THE hardball question.&gt;&gt;<br>
							((Quiet.))<br>
							<font color="079866">RG:</font> It was an easy decision. The Children of Phoenix are the First Tribe, and we've borne the responsibility of the Firetruce for centuries. It was time to see whether one of the other tribes was willing to shoulder the responsibilities of leading the search for tribal unity.<br>
							<font color="05d200">ZV:</font> So you're ceding leadership to the Diamond Sword?</div></p>
							<div ul style="text-align:center;"><p><font color="e8b857">ZOOM TO CLOSE UP OF PHOENIX PRIME.</font></div></p>
							<div ul style="text-align:left;"><p><font color="079866">RG:</font> We're not relinquishing our historic primacy, no. We are broadening the scope of who may participate in steering the institution, however. I can tell you Unity will not happen unless all the Great Tribes take a fair share of responsibility. That means we Phoenix have to adopt a more inclusive strategy.</p></div>

							&lt;&lt;She's cute.&gt;&gt;<br>
							((She's a scion of the Phoenix. Read the files Imperial Sec has compiled on her.))<br>
							<font color="079866">RG:</font> (laughs) You have found us out, Jamez. The independents must also play a role.<br>
							<font color="05d200">ZV:</font> Let's turn to her for a moment. She's very young, isn't she?<br>
							<font color="079866">RG:</font> Yes, but I - we - have the utmost confidence that she will rise to the occasion. She's a remarkable individual.<br>
							<font color="05d200">ZV:</font> Very popular among the independents. Did you choose her yourself, Milord?<br>
							<font color="079866">RG:</font> Hardly. We worked with the Diamond Sword on Firetruce arrangements, and her name floated to the top.<br>
							<font color="05d200">ZV:</font> Milord, are you an aficionado of Trigon?<br>
							<font color="079866">RG:</font> Eh?<br>
							<font color="05d200">ZV:</font> This board between us. There's a game in progress, obviously. Who's your opponent?</div></p>
							<div ul style="text-align:center;"><p><font color="e8b857">PAN TO BOARD</font></div></p>
							<div ul style="text-align:left;"><font color="079866"><p>RG:</font> Ah, yes. Trigon is such an elegant game. So subtle. I'm not very good, you know, but I hope to improve. Here I'm merely playing against myself.<br>
							((I believe he's lying here. The indicators show a tension spike. Look here. And here.))<br>
							&lt;&lt;Interesting. You think there's something else going on.&gt;&gt;<br>
							((Yes. Take a still of that board position and have it analyzed. Get a para-sape on it.))<br>
							<font color="05d200">ZV:</font> Sort of a mental exercise, then?</div></p>
							<div ul style="text-align:center;"><p><font color="e8b857">PAN BACK</font></div></p>
							<div ul style="text-align:left;"><font color="079866"><p>RG:</font> Exactly. I'm afraid I only have time for one more question.<br>
							<font color="05d200">ZV:</font> Already?<br>
							<font color="079866">RG:</font> (laughs) Now that obviously isn't your question, Jamez. But yes, I have a taxing schedule and not much time. Please try again.<br>
							<font color="05d200">ZV:</font> Very well, Milord. How do you respond to Anton Malderi's accusations that you have sold the Children of Phoenix out to further your personal agenda and cement your place in history?<br>
							&lt;&lt;Now she's just fishing. Malderi's a psychopath and everyone knows it.&gt;&gt;<br>
							((He's very popular in the Children of Phoenix. Remember, he's calling for a return to the good old days of elitist glory. He could be a real threat to the Empire if he wins power.))<br>
							&lt;&lt;That'll never happen.&gt;&gt;<br>
							((I think it will.))</div></p>
							<div ul style="text-align:center;"><p><font color="e8b857">CLOSE UP ON GISTOS</font></div></p>

							Alexandre Konovalev and Freya Cloudchaser.<br>
							It seemed a modern Romeo and Juliet story: the brilliant young ruler of the Blood Eagle and the beautiful daughter of a Starwolf Chieftain united in matrimony as a symbol of peace between two warring tribes.<br></div>
							<div ul style="text-align:center;"><em><p>Music -- Albinoni's Cinque in G Minor, first movement</em></p>
							<div ul style="text-align:left;"><font color="red">VIDCLIP</font> - A handsome young couple smiles at the camera. He is dark-haired and aquiline, clad in a blood-red dress uniform; she is blonde, blue-eyed, and wears a white robe adorned with a stylized wolf knotwork pattern. He holds a heavy saber at a jaunty angle. She holds a spear decorated with a trail of Kyorn feathers.</p>
							<p>Man (stealing a tender glance at the woman): Let this marriage represent an end to the traditional hostility between our tribes. We can make a new beginning, all of us. Together we need not choose war.<br>
							Woman (gravely): If Wolf and Eagle can make peace, can the rest of the wilderzone be far behind?</div></p>
							<div ul style="text-align:center;"><font color="e8b857"><p>NARRATOR</p></font></div>
							<div ul style="text-align:left;"><p>Reality would not to live up to the hopes kindled by the marriage of early part of 3904, despite the birth of twins in 3904 and a second son in 3905. Indeed, the falling-out of these star-crossed lovers would eventually claim the lives of their children and leave their tribes deeply entangled in a web of bitter hatred and bloodshed.</p>
							<p><font color="red">VIDCLIP</font> - Image of Alexandre and Freya freezes, and flames consume it, leaving the faces until the end.</p>

							<div ul style="text-align:left;"><p>The disastrous culmination of their separation would take place in 3932 with the use of ecocidal weapons on the Starwolf world of Hepta Ourubis Two. H-O Two, as it is commonly called, is located near the edge of Blood Eagle Territory. A jumpgate thread leads to the B-E world of Shaakhar Crucis, an important hub with links to the key Blood Eagle worlds of Bira Marduk and Bloodjewel.</p>

							<div ul style="text-align:center;"><font color="e8b857"><p>NARRATOR</p></font></div>
							<p>The years after 3904 saw a steadily growing estrangement between Alexandre and Freya, a division fueled by Alexandre's deteriorating temper. But the early years were good, and the couple seemed to personify the hopes of the wilderzone for peace between the Blood Eagle and the Starwolf.</p>
							<font color="red"><p>VIDCLIP</font> - A dark-haired toddler boy laughs and plays with Alexandre. Freya sits in foreground holding a golden-headed infant. A second dark-haired toddler watches from next to Freya's chair, a shadow on her face.</p>
							<div ul style="text-align:center;"><font color="e8b857"><p>NARRATOR</p></font></div>
							<p>As the years wore on, Alexandre utterly indulged his second son Ulysses, permitting the boy any liberty he wished and showing little regard for anyone else, especially his first-born children Geoffrey and Alyxandra. Ulysses would inherit signs of his father's strategic genius, but his talent was obscured by his contempt for the advice of anyone other than than his father, even his respected weapons instructor and bodyguard, Sikkyn-Captain Starkar Mace. Mace had been assigned to guard Freya shortly after the announcement of the betrothal, and she insisted he become the special protector of her son. He and Ulysses developed a close relationship.</p>
							<p><font color="red">VIDCLIP</font> - On a balcony overlooking a frozen lake, a young Ulysses throws his furred hood back and looks up at his father, revealing a head of bright golden hair.
							Cut to a procession in Court at Outermost. Alexandre walks with Ulysses at his side while two slender dark-haird children walk behind. Alexandre puts his arm around Ulysses's shoulder and squeezes before letting go and ascending to take his place on the throne. At this point, Ulysses is still</p>
							<p>Cut to Ulysses as a young teenager, tall and well-muscled. He examines a katar in the company of a powerfully-built, square-jawed warrior. They stand on what appears to be a training ground in a courtyard. Freya watches from a balcony in the background as the older man demonstrates a fighting stance.</p>
							<div ul style="text-align:center;"><font color="e8b857"><p>NARRATOR</p></font></div>
							<p>Sometime in 3910, Alexandre began to change. His attitude toward the Starwolf became first distant, then increasingly quarrelsome as he began to display signs of paranoia and an uncontrollable temper. Ulysses remained the center of his world.</p>
							<p><font color="red">VIDCLIP</font> - Alexandre presides over a Court meeting on Outermost. He looks tense. Deep lines have etched themselves in his face. Ulysses stands behind him, taller and in his late teens. He is broad-shouldered and deep chested, every inch the warrior born. His lip curls as he hears something said by a courtier.</p>
							<div ul style="text-align:center;"><font color="e8b857"><p>NARRATOR</p></font></div>
							<p>Alexandre had little time for his other children, and even sent his daughter to be fostered by another Bloodline in 3915, over Freya's objections.</p>
							<p><font color="red">VIDCLIP</font> - Freya hugs a dark-haired young girl goodbye as a shuttle prepares to depart. There are no tears, but their embrace lingers, and the girl visibly catches her breath before climbing up the ramp to enter the shuttle.</p>
							<div ul style="text-align:center;"><font color="e8b857"><p>NARRATOR</p></font></div>
							<p>The cracks between husband and wife deepened to a crevasse as Alexandre grew even more intolerant and short-tempered. Freya was a strong-willed, patient woman, and kept her peace until 3924, when her eldest son Geoffrey committed suicide after resigning from tribal military service. Geoffrey had always been poorly disposed to military discipline, being of a more refined intellectual temperament. His position as firstborn heir meant he had little choice but to follow a military career.</p>
							<font color="red"><p>VIDCLIP</font> - Picture of Geoffrey Alexandre Konovalev, dark and serious, holding a stiff pose in front of a turbograv fighter craft. He wears a resplendent dress uniform, but his eyes are large and haunted. His slender form is unremarkable compared with the leonine Ulysses Konovalev.</p>
							<p>At a state dinner several weeks later, the Great Eagle publicly humiliated a grieving Freya for a comment suggesting that the Blood Eagle's training customs could be reformed.</p>
							<font color="red"><p>VIDCLIP</font> - A sumptious state dinner on Outermost. Camera pans along a well-laden table. Guests wear Starwolf and Blood Eagle uniforms. The murmur of conversation blends with the clink of silverware and fine crystal. Chamber music plays in the background. Suddenly a commotion erupts from the head of the table. A voice is heard exclaiming, "No! I forbid it! Even the thought suggests treason! He was unfit, I tell you!"</p>
							<p>"Damn it, Alexandre, li-"<br>
							The camera view blurs to focus on the source of the noise and catches Alexandre as he leaps to his feet and swings his hand across Freya's face with a sharp crack. Her head snaps to one side with the force of the blow.
							Everything falls silent. The music trails off. A white-faced Freya rises slowly, her cheek flaming where her husband struck her. Alexandre glares at her, breathing hard. Without a word, she spins and leaves, pausing only to lock eyes for a moment with Ulysses, who sits at Alexandre's right hand. After a moment, her son looks away, but makes no move from his seat. Starkar Mace intercepts Freya and escorts her from the room.<p>
							<p>Camera returns to pan back along the table. The Blood Eagle remain frozen-faced. Several Starwolf are on their feet, their expressions grim, fists clenched. Someone coughs. Alexandre sits and motions for the music to resume.</p>
							<div ul style="text-align:center;"><font color="e8b857"><p>NARRATOR</p></font></div>
							<p>It was the last straw for the proud Starwolf warrior. Freya left Alexandre two days later, disappearing in the middle of the night. Ulysses remained behind. The Great Eagle was completely enraged. Accounts from anonymous court sources claim Alexandre decimated the house guard on duty the night his wife departed. These sources also claim Alexandre's mental condition took a far more bloodthirsty turn following the loss of his relationship with Freya. The great tragedy, they maintained, was that the Great Eagle truly loved his wife.</p>

							<p>One week after Freya's disappearance, Ulysses Konovalev assumed command of his father's elite Marathon Pennant to recapture his mother and return her to Outermost. In his speech to the Assembled Bloodlines of the tribe, Alexandre claimed Freya had been "taken" by Starwolf wishing to use her as a hostage against the Blood Eagle.</p>
							<font color="red"><p>VIDCLIP</font> - Alexandre stands in Court, grim and white-faced. Camera pans across a cavernous room full of uniformed officers before returning to Alexandre. The Great Eagle appears barely under control, passions raging under a thin veneer of decorum.
							"Siers, I cannot tell you how deeply this destructive act wounds the relations between our tribes. Freya Cloudchaser is my wife. She is the mother of my son. I will never surrender her to the mercies of the Starwolf…."</p>
							<div ul style="text-align:center;"><font color="e8b857"><p>NARRATOR</p></font></div>
							<p>Starkar Mace accompanied Ulysses, despite what Mace's friends described as grave misgivings. Over the next five months, the Marathon Pennant struck a series of Starwolf holdings Ulysses believed had harbored Freya. Mace objected to this course of action. He also tried to dissuade his longtime pupil from attacking Hepta Ourubis Two, as reports indicated the Hepta Ourubis Pack had pulled together a massive force. Unfortunately, Ulysses refused to listen. Though Mace remained close to his protégé, the young Konovalev, now twenty years old, had inherited his father's blind pride.</p>

							<p>"So much for this group of yappers," he says with a confident grin. "Who's next?"</p>

							<p>The Hepta Ourubis Pack was formidable, led by the Warlord Nevor M'Klannin, an experienced campaigner not given to rash judgments. Despite his flair for tactics and leadership, Ulysses lacked any real combat experience and was completely outmatched. He did not take advice well.</p>

							<p>Alexandre Achilleus Konovalev spoke to no living soul for nine days. On the tenth day, he emerged from his quarters and committed the Blood Eagle to the utter destruction of the entire Starwolf tribe.</p>
							<p><font color="red">VIDCLIP</font> - Freeze frame of a wide-eyed Great Eagle standing in battle armor before the Court. His face twists in rage. He thrusts the curved blade of a khanjar into the air.</p>

							<div ul style="text-align:center;"><font color="e8b857"><p>NARRATOR</p></font></div>
							<p>Yet despite his revitalized leadership and the guidance of his brilliant generalship, Alexandre's instability finally crystallized a seed of opposition. At the end of 3926, the Commander of the Order of Wrath's elite Eviscerator Talon, which spearheaded the renewed offensive against the Starwolf, was a woman known only by her warnom: "Fury."</p>

							<p>She rose in rank like a comet, propelled by success after success on the battlefield. In the coming years, both her popularity among her troops and her independence from Outermost would grow.</p>
							<p><font color="red">VIDCLIP</font> - Slow zoom in to image of Fury from previous shot. She appears surprisingly young for her rank. Her expression is grave, almost sad, and the corners of her mouth are tight, as if she disapproves of having her picture taken. The patch is like a yawning hole in her face.</p>
							<div ul style="text-align:center;"><font color="e8b857"><p>NARRATOR</p></font></div>
							<p>Today she is Alexandre's chief rival, and the Blood Eagle are torn between their oaths of loyalty to a failing House on the one hand and the promise of a vigorous new leader on the other.</p>
							<p>The future of the tribe rests on how the Blood Eagle choose. Will they go to a civil war, fighting over the throne as they did following the death of Grand Master Paramount Hector Komarosu back in 3831? That conflict caused more B-E deaths than any other war in the wilderzone, and has been pointed to as the bloodiest of any tribal war.</p>
							<p>Very soon, the Blood Eagle will play out their destiny, and we shall see whether the brilliant but unstable House Konovalev can weather the storm.</p>

							<div ul style="text-align:center;"><h3>Chapter 7</h3><br>
							<p><font color="e8b857">DEMON-CORE - part 3</font></p>
							<p>The time had come.</p>
							<p>Demon-Core nodded in satisfaction as he examined the hulking figures lining the assault ship's personnel bay, listened to the clack of weapon readiness, saw the gleam of light reflected from carapaces, horns, and glory plates. The grigatim had deployed into three spear-shaped craft in preparation for the attack on the Starwolf ship Retribution. This was Demon-Core's command. The invasion fleet's vanguard, of which they were a part, had dropped out of jumpthread fifteen minutes ago, disguised as Imperial trading vessels under a flag of neutrality. Each ship contained several assault craft packed with elite feroxi. Now the grigatim waited for the Steers to power the combat drives and burn for the objective.
							The feroxi musk was very strong in the cramped confines of the assault ship. Demon-Core grunted and tilted his head back and forth to loosen his neck muscles. He'd checked and rechecked his carapace to be sure the jets and shields were functioning. Both the chaingun and the plascannon he carried were in excellent working order.</p>
							<p>There was nothing left to do but wait a little longer. The killing would start soon. Urrh, but that would be good. Practicing patience had become a strain. He was eager to win more glory plates and reinforce his status as the grigatim's kill leader. He looked forward to battle again. It was what he had been bred for, after all.</p>
							<p>Of course, the human woman must be caught. Demon-Core had studied the layout of this "Retribution." It was a large ship. They would doubtless have to kill many humans while searching. He growled low in his throat, pleased at the prospect of action after so long a wait. Even shikahl had grown tiresome.</p>
							<p>"Mighty One, what are you thinking?" The Flaymaster's Inquisitor had attached itself to Demon-Core's group, a fact the Goliath greeted with a mix of elation and revulsion. Inquisitors were holy, yes, but they were also a burden. One had to protect them, and at times aggressive Inquisitors undermined a group's combat efficiency with misplaced threats or conclusions about a particular strain.
							Besides, Demon-Core hated the weak, treacherous things.</p>
							<p>He bared his teeth in greeting. "I consider the tactical situation that faces us once we come to our target."</p>
							<p>"What is your assessment?"</p>
							<p>"Urh-hah! The Starwolf do not expect us. They will be slow in their reaction. We will destroy them, for we are Strong!" Even as he said the words he knew the Inquisitor wished to hear, Demon-Core wondered why the Strong must always continue to proclaim their strength. Surely the true Strong had no need of constant boasts. It was a strange thought. Perhaps the leader of the Burning Ones was stronger than they thought.
							Apparently satisfied, the Inquisitor scuttled up to its berth. Demon-Core breathed a silent thanks to the Bloodsoul and rubbed one massive arm.
							Blood-Drinker lumbered up and locked himself into the harness at Demon-Core's left. "Hai, Demon-Core, my friend!" he rumbled happily. "Very soon now, urrh?" His harness carried a grenade launcher, a chaingun, and a spinfusor. Bulky looking to Demon-Core, but Goliaths could afford to carry extra weapons.</p>
							<p>"Arha. Very soon. How are the others?"</p>
							<p>The other Goliath shrugged. "Afraid. Why, my friend, did you pick any smaller ones to accompany us? With a go-lahk of Goliaths, we could forge ahead in glory."</p>
							<p>"We will bring much glory to the grigatim." Demon-Core squinted so that he could see his friend in the near-blackness. "The Runners bring us speed if we need it, and the Plunderer the same, but with more strength."</p>
							<p>"They are all young. Mere freshlings." Blood-Drinker sounded so mournfully doubtful that Demon-Core laughed, a sound like the grate of metal on bone.</p>
							<p>Not Khel-Har the Unstoppable! He is worth three Goliaths, urrha?"</p>
							<p>Blood-Drinker chuckled deep in his throat. "Yes, you are right. The Unstoppable is one who knows battle. Even his shadow is enough to kill a human!"</p>
							<p>Demon-Core laughed again. It was an old joke between the two of them. The Goliath they spoke of was an abnormally huge specimen, one the Inquisitors would have sent to the reclaiming vats years ago, except for two things. Khel-Har had the talent of being almost impervious to pain, even for one of the Hordes. Second, he proved exceptionally good at killing humans. Had he been smarter, he might have become a candidate for <p>Kill-Leader. However, he could not react to the unexpected as quickly as the average feroxi.</p>
							A vibration resonated through the assault craft, and Demon-Core felt a brief flash of nausea that signaled the use of acceleration dampeners.
							"We find out now whether the plan is Strong," he told Blood-Drinker. If the Starwolf were able to attack the assault ship in transit, there was nothing Demon-Core could do; it was all in the hands of the Steers.</p>
							<p>Their was a good plan, he thought, but no plan was perfect. There was evidently a tribe of humans who took pride in perfect planning, however. Demon-Core looked forward to teaching them the foolishness of such vanity.</p>
							<p>Long minutes passed.</p>
							<p>Beside him Blood-Drinker exhaled slowly. Demon-Core let his own breath escape, forcing it to be calm, even though his hearts beat fast.
							May the seed of my plasm grind the slaver filth into the dust, he recited silently. May the shadows of our past vanish like smoke in the fiery wake of our passage….</p>
							<p>Abruptly, a faint acceleration could be perceived, a low hum that increased gradually in pitch. Their commlinks hissed.
							"This is the Flaymaster. We are through the first ring of defenses, and our target lies ahead. Prepare for impact."</p>
							<p>"Come on, vatscum!" he roared. "Show these tribal humans the mercy of Horde Maul!"</p>
							<p>"For the Bloodsoul!" thundered the feroxi. Demon-Core thought he heard a note of relief in their voices. He had to admit that if he were to die, he would prefer it in direct battle, roaring and displaying his glory plates. The thought of perishing in the cold of space like a fish spilled from a broken tank unsettled him. His hearts filled with pride at the thought of going into battle with such strong companions.
							<p>His HUD flashed up a message: Impact in T minus two minutes.</p>
							Blood-Drinker leaned over and nudged him with an elbow. "My friend, I have decided we shall keep the freshlings safe while they learn strength. It is our duty as the Strong."</p>
							<p>Demon-Core began to chuckle, then he realized his friend was serious. "Don't talk like that, Blood-Drinker," he said. "There are some-" he swung his head to point his horns at the Inquisitor's nest, "-who would consider such a statement weak."</p>
							<p>"Weak? Me?" Blood-Drinker chortled. "It's a blind Inquisitor who would think that! But enough! A game, O Demon-Core, mighty Kill-Leader!"</p>
							<p>"Rrrh?"</p>
							<p>"I challenge you! Let us count our kills on this ship. The one with the lower kill number must polish the other's equipment for a week and fetch biru for him besides!"</p>
							<p>Demon-Core considered it, scraping one of his tusks with a talon. His HUD read Impact in T minus thirty seconds. "Done! I am Kill-Leader, and I will beat you in this also! But listen you: guard your great flapping tongue, urr-ha?"</p>
							<p>Blood-Drinker tapped talon to horn in mock salute. "I hear and obey, Kill-Leader!"</p>
							<p>"Good." Demon-Core clapped his friend on the shoulder and bellowed, "Brace yourselves, vatscum!" The ship would spear into the Retribution and break open at the bow so that the feroxi could pour into the Starwolf vessel. It would be a fearful impact, and not all the feroxi survived, though Demon-Core felt confident they would suffer few losses. This was a veteran grigatim. All of them had been through at least one capital ship boarding.</p>
							<p>In the dim light of the carrier bay, the feroxi tensed. Demon-Core stole a glance at the Inquisitor's nest, where the holy one crouched amid sophisticated padding that would cushion it against the crash. To his surprise, he saw the glow of the Inquisitor's gaze directed at him. For a moment, he felt great unease, wondering whether the Inquisition suspected his plasm of any flaw.
							Then he realized the Inquisitor's attention was directed at Blood-Drinker. Suddenly Demon-Core felt fear for his friend, a dark feeling that marred his excitement at the upcoming battle.</p>
							<p>T minus five seconds. Four. Three. Two. One.</p>
							<p><div ul style="text-align:center;"><font color="red">IMPACT.</font></p></div>

							<p>"You're nuts," Mace said. He shook his head. "Ymir's a deathtrap, Alyx."</p>
							<p>Alyxandra Helena Konovalev regarded him quietly, arms folded across her chest, then turned to face her brother. "What do you think, Lex?"
							Ulysses Alexandre Konovalev looked troubled as he set his coffee down. When he spoke, his words came out carefully, as if discussing these matters was a language strange to him.</p>
							<p>"I think… you've considered this whole thing carefully, but it's still basically a huge gamble." He shrugged. "Sorry. It's been a long time since I've had to think about anything other than moving rocks. I'm probably not the best qualified to offer judgment on military strategy."
							"Don't give me that," she snapped. "You were the brightest star in Outermost's academy, and your scores have never been eclipsed-"</p>
							<p>"Present company excepted," Mace cut in. "Give him a break, Alyx. He's been in limbo for almost half his life, not to mention the memory loss."</p>
							<p>Lex held up a hand. "Let be, Dad. She's right."</p>
							<p>She stiffened at the open reference to Mace's status. "I see there are no longer any secrets."</p>
							<p>"In private," Mace said. "In public he's still Alexandre's - actually, right now he's nobody. A minstrel's prentice. Regarding the relationship, though, I didn't realize it for a long time myself." He looked embarrassed. "Goes to show what you'll hide from yourself if you try hard enough."</p>
							<p>"Funny thing about memory all around," Lex continued. "Mine was gone for a long time, but what I've gotten back is so clear, it's like… like it happened yesterday. Everything. That mnemonic implanter I was stuck with gave me a lot more than-"</p>
							<p>"Lex," Mace warned.</p>
							<p>"Yeah. Right." Lex rubbed his temple and gave Fury a shaky grin. She resolved to ferret out what they'd just hidden from her, but it would wait.</p>
							<p>"Those sims you ran for us are pretty detailed," he continued. "You've thought of a lot of stuff I wouldn't have: situation-response formations, jamming salvos out the gate, remora fighter launch and mine deployment… Dark, it's a lot to absorb."</p>
							<p>"I've had a lot of time to think about it," Fury said, part of her brain filing away her brother's use of the Starwolf epithet.
							"What I want to know is why you're so convinced going to Ymir is necessary," Lex said. "If the Bloodlines are already mobilizing, isn't that enough?"</p>
							<p>Mace leaned back and blew air out his cheeks in exasperation. "Maybe not. Alexandre still rules, and nobody will move without his say-so. That it, Alyx? You want to give them something they can't ignore? Are you finally making a play for the throne?" Two gray eyes bored into her one.</p>
							<p>"I want to inspire them to act without waiting for a madman's orders." Fury met his gaze. It was difficult, matching wills with this man from her childhood, but she managed, adding, "I don't want to rule, Starkar. I hate Outermost and the backstabbing politics that infects the Court. Besides, it would trigger a true civil war, and I won't be responsible for that."</p>
							<p>"Why not?" Mace asked. "You're threatening one right now."</p>
							<p>"A false threat. I won't let it lead to bloodshed."</p>
							<p>"I don't know that it's in your hands anymore. I picked up some rumors of division in the ranks. For example, the Crimson Suns Order may declare for you openly if Eun Alba's staff can convince him to take the leap."</p>
							<p>Mace picked up his coffee and took a leisurely swig. "Tell me, Alyx: How is it you've kept your secret all these years? If the Orders knew you were Konovalev, there'd be a lot of support for placing you on the throne."</p>
							<p>Fury took a sip from her mug of tea before answering. "First tell me how you guessed," she said. "It's not common knowledge, to say the least, and I don't have the same face you knew me by."</p>
							<p>"No special brilliance on my part, I'm afraid." Mace laughed and put the mug down. "Old Starkweather and I were good friends, you might recall. I kept in touch off and on over the years, and he tipped me off when I sent word to him about returning to B-E space. Said you'd done him proud."</p>
							<p>"I'll roast him," she said without rancor. "We worked damned hard to make the cover and make sure it stuck." Lex looked completely lost, so she decided to explain. "You know I was fostered with the Starkweathers. Shortly after you were lost, there was an assassination attempt. I was the target. Somebody tried to leave the tribe without an heir." She rubbed her eye patch uneasily. "Obviously, they failed, but we decided to put out that they'd succeeded."</p>
							<p>"Why?" Lex asked.</p>
							<p>"The assassin was good, too good. Brilliant, in fact, and so highly trained it's a miracle I made it out alive. We still can't tell you where he came from, but it wasn't Cardinal Spear, and I don't think it was the Empire. We didn't get a chance to interrogate him, either."
							"Like Nagashima back when," Mace said.</p>
							<p>"Exactly."</p>
							<p>"How'd you make it, if he was so good?" Lex prompted.</p>
							<p>"That's my secret," she said.</p>
							<p>"Good enough," Mace said. Lex nodded, and Fury continued.</p>
							<p>"We provided a body with the appropriate injuries, and I went through surgery to alter my features, my voice, and my geneprint. Afterwards, Starkweather put me into his forces as an orphan, an obscure ward of the Bloodline whose parents were killed in '15. My history is sketchy, and I'm listed as six years older than I am. There are a few other details to make it stick, but essentially I'm supposed to be from nobody stock."
							<p>"And Cardinal Spear bought it?" Mace asked. "Alexandre didn't throw a fit?"</p>
							Fury smiled. "My idea. The assassin did hit someone, you see. Starkweather's niece Fienna. She lived, but in a permanent coma. We altered her to look like me and sent her 'home' to Outermost." She stared at the table, a lump suddenly in her throat. "Father had her killed within a week. Nobody mentions my-her-name at Court. Or anywhere." Old memories flooded her, and she didn't know how to handle them. These two men brought back so much she'd buried. She drew a deep breath and looked up. Lex had a troubled expression on his face, almost a guilty one. Mace reached out and squeezed her arm.</p>
							<p>"Alyxandra Helena Konovalev has been dead for fifteen years. She doesn't exist." She steeled her voice. "There's only Fury. And I have earned my rank." Lex froze at the last sentence. She'd said it sharply, but he needed to know how things stood with her, what she valued. "I think the question here is: what now? Do you plan to return to Outermost, brother?"</p>
							<p>He stared at his fists for a long moment. When he answered, his voice was soft but determined. "No. I've been… away… for a long time. A thrall. It wouldn't be smart right now. I'm not qualified to take up where I left off. And I don't think I want to. I'm not the same person I was, memories or not."</p>
							<p>"You're a powerful symbol, son," Mace said. "People have already seen you and made guesses. Rumors have started."</p>
							<p>"Just guesses, just rumors." Lex raised his head and turned his full attention to Fury. "I want to go with you, Alyx. To Ymir."</p>
							<p>"Oh, Christ and Hunter." Mace thumped the table. "Not you, too. Is having a death wish a family trait?"</p>
							<p>Fury sat back and scrutinized her brother. He was sincere, she realized. Completely sincere. He'd never been adept at deception. Not like a full Konovalev, she thought bitterly. Not like her.</p>
							<p>"You're the heir to the Exiled Bloodlines, like it or not," she said. "How can I take you into a 'deathtrap' when you may offer a peaceful succession to the tribe? Give me a compelling reason, Lex. Otherwise, you stay here out of the line of fire." Out of the corner of her eye, she saw Mace nod in agreement.</p>
							<p>Lex leaned toward her, blue eyes ablaze. Uncertainty fell away from him like a cloak. In that moment, she saw her mother's features and Mace's blended so strongly that she wondered how anyone could ever have believed a drop of Konovalev blood ran through this man's veins.</p>
							<p>"So I can earn my rank, Sirdar-Prime," he said.</p>
