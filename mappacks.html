		<meta name="description" content="Tribes 2 isn't easy to master, but when you're up and running it's a tremendous amount of fun. It is a team-based first-person-shooter designed primarily for online multiplay. While getting kills certainly helps, the player must also achieve the various objectives specified in the scenario, ranging from attack-and-hold objective, to assaults on enemy fortresses, taking enemy flags, and more. Each member must weigh the trade-off between firepower and protection, as well how much ammo to carry. Tribes 2 adds vehicles to the mix, as well as a new race, and larger maps.">
